<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>"TIPPED OFF" BY WIG-WAG</h3>


<div class='cap'>LIEUTENANT POPE, battalion adjutant
of the first battalion of the Thirty-fourth
United States Infantry, looked up from
his office desk as the door swung open and a
smart, trim-looking young corporal strode in.</div>

<p>Pausing before the desk, the young corporal
came to a precise, formal salute. Then, dropping
his right hand to his side, the soldier stood
at attention.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Corporal Overton."</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you wish?"</p>

<p>"I have been making inquiries, sir," continued
Corporal Hal Overton, "and I am informed
that you have some signaling flags
among the quartermaster's stores."</p>

<p>"I believe I have," nodded Lieutenant Pope.</p>

<p>"I have come to ask, sir, if I may borrow
a couple of the flags."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Borrow? Then, Corporal, I take it that
you do not want the flags for duty purposes?"</p>

<p>"Not immediately for duty purposes, sir.
Corporal Terry and myself would like to practise
at wig-wagging until we become reasonably
expert. Sergeant Hupner is an expert at wig-wagging,
I understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," agreed Lieutenant Pope
heartily. "Even in the Signal Corps of the
Army there are few better signalmen than the
sergeant."</p>

<p>"So I understand, sir. Corporal Terry and
I are delighted at the idea of having the sergeant
instruct us."</p>

<p>"But what do you want to do, especially, with
flag signaling?" inquired the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"It is simply, sir, that we want to make ourselves
better soldiers."</p>

<p>"It is rarely that we find better soldiers than
Terry and yourself," replied the quartermaster,
with a friendly smile. "But you are quite
right, none the less. A soldier can never know
too much of military duties. I see no objection
whatever to your having the flags, but as they
are not a matter of ordinary issue, I think it
better for me to seek Major Silsbee's authority
for issuing them."</p>

<p>"Would it have been better if I had gone to
the battalion commander in the first place, sir?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; whenever you wish anything in the
Army it is usually better to go direct to the
officer who has that thing in charge in his department,
save when it is something that you
are expected to draw through your company
officers."</p>

<p>"It was Captain Cortland who sent me to you,
sir, but he said he had no authority to draw a
requisition for signal flags."</p>

<p>"You have taken the right course, Corporal.
If Major Silsbee is in his office it will take but
a moment more."</p>

<p>While the young corporal remained at attention
Lieutenant Pope turned to his telephone
and called for the battalion commander.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Corporal," nodded the lieutenant,
hanging up the receiver. Then he wrote
on a slip of official paper. "Here is an order
on which the quartermaster sergeant will issue
you two signal flags. You are, of course, responsible
for the flags, or for the value."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Corporal Hal Overton
stepped briskly from the building in which the
quartermaster's stores were kept. Under his
left arm he carried two signal flags, rolled and
attached to short staffs.</p>

<p>"Noll hasn't shown up yet. I hope he won't
be long," murmured Hal, gazing across the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
parade grounds in the direction of the barracks
of enlisted men. "Bunkie and I have a lot to
do to-day."</p>

<p>Readers of the preceding volumes in this series
will need no introduction to Corporals Hal Overton
and Noll Terry, of the Thirty-fourth United
States Infantry.</p>

<p>The headquarters battalion to which these
two earnest young soldiers were attached was
still stationed at Fort Clowdry. Readers of
"<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam's Boys in the Ranks</span>" are
familiar with the circumstances under which
Overton and Terry first enlisted at a recruiting
office in New York City. These same readers
also know how the two young soldiers put in
several weeks of steady drilling at a recruit
rendezvous near New York, where they learned
the first steps in the soldier's strenuous calling.
Our readers are also familiar with all the many
things that happened during that period of recruit
instruction, and how Hal and Noll, while
traveling through the Rockies on their way to
join their regiment, aided in resisting an attempt
by robbers to hold up the United States
mail train. Our readers are well aware of all
the exciting episodes of that first garrison life,
including the life and death fight that Hal Overton
had with thieves while he was on sentry duty
in officers' row, and of the efforts of one worthless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
character in the battalion to discredit and
disgrace the service of both splendid but new
young soldiers.</p>

<p>In the second volume, "<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam's Boys
on Field Duty</span>," our readers were admitted to
equally exciting scenes of a wholly different
nature. This volume dealt largely with the
troops while away in rough country, under practical
instruction in the actual duties of soldiers
in the field in war time. Just how soldiers learn
the grim business of war was most fully set forth
in this volume. Among other hosts of entertaining
incidents our readers will recall how Hal,
on scouting duty, robbed the "enemy's" outpost
of rifles, canteens and secured even the corporal's
shoes. Some of Hal's and Noll's other
brilliant scouting successes are therein told, and
it is described how Hal and Noll finally gained
the information that resulted in their own side
gaining the victory in the mimic campaign. That
volume also told how Lieutenant Prescott, aided
by Soldiers Hal and Noll, succeeded at very
nearly the cost of their lives in arresting a notorious
and desperate criminal for the civil authorities,
and how all this was done in the most soldier-like
manner. It was such deeds as the
scouting and the clever arrest that resulted in
the appointment of the two chums as corporals.
Then there was the affair, while the regulars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
were on duty in summer encampment with the
Colorado National Guard, in which Hal and
Noll, acting under impulses of the highest
chivalry, got themselves into trouble that came
very near to driving them out of the service.</p>

<p>Since the last rousing scenes in and near Denver,
something more than a year had passed.
It was now the beginning of the fall of the year
following when Corporal Hal Overton, with the
signal flags under his arm, waited near the
parade ground for that other fine young soldier,
Corporal Noll Terry.</p>

<p>A year of busy life it had been, though in
the main uneventful. Our two young corporals
had spent most of their time since in perfecting
themselves in the soldier's grim game. They
were now looked upon as two of the very finest
and staunchest young soldiers in the service.</p>

<p>"Oh, there comes Noll at last," muttered
Corporal Overton some minutes later. "And
it's high time, too, if he has any regard for the
sacredness of a soldier's punctuality. But he's
leaving the telegraph office. I wonder if the
dear old fellow has been getting any bad news
from the home town?"</p>

<p>Corporal Terry, as he came briskly along the
smooth, hard walk of a well-kept military post,
looked every inch as fine a soldier as his chum.
By this time Noll was just as thoroughly in love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with all that pertained to the soldier's spirited
life as was Overton.</p>

<p>"Think I was never coming?" hailed Noll
gayly.</p>

<p>"I began to wonder if you weren't losing sight
of the sacredness that is supposed to be attached
to a soldier's appointment," said Hal dryly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have been so carried away
with a new chance that I've treated you just a
bit shabbily," Corporal Noll admitted.</p>

<p>"Think no more of it," begged Hal. "I got
the flags."</p>

<p>"So my eyes tell me."</p>

<p>"And what have you been up to, Noll?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the greatest chance!" glowed Terry.
"You know how hard I have been plugging
away at telegraphy in spare time during the
last few months?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, Lieutenant Ray is through with his
tour of duty as officer in charge of our telegraph
station, and Lieutenant Prescott has succeeded
him for the next tour."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I've been over to the telegraph office to interview
Lieutenant Prescott, whom I saw going
in there. Prescott is a grand young officer, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Every man in the battalion knows that," Hal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
agreed heartily, for, indeed, there were no two
more popular young officers in the service than
Lieutenants Prescott and Holmes, of B and C
Companies, respectively.</p>

<p>Readers of our "<span class="smcap">High School Boys' Series</span>"
and of the "<span class="smcap">West Point Series</span>" know all about
Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes, once leaders
among High School athletes and afterwards
among the brightest and finest of West Point
cadets. Prescott and Holmes were now fully
launched in their careers as Army officers.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Prescott has given me a really
bully chance," Noll went on happily.</p>

<p>"Did you ask him for it?" suspected Corporal
Hal shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;hinted some, I guess," responded
Noll, with a quiet grin. "But if you
want things in this world aren't you a heap
more likely to get them by asking than by keeping
quiet?"</p>

<p>"Surely. But go on and tell me what it is
that you got."</p>

<p>"I haven't exactly got it yet," Noll continued.
"But Lieutenant Prescott is going to recommend
me for it, and ask Captain Cortland's permission."</p>

<p>"I guess you'll get it, then," nodded Hal
Overton. "Mr. Prescott's superior officers think
so highly of him that he usually doesn't have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to beg very hard to get what he wants. And&mdash;what
is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, old fellow, I'm to be relieved from
most other duties and placed in charge of the
telegraph office. You know, there are two soldiers
stationed there as day operators, and one
as night operator. And I'm to be there in
charge night and day."</p>

<p>"Good business," nodded Hal, "if you don't
have to keep up night and day as well."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'm to be merely responsible to the
lieutenant for the proper management of the
office. I'm not to be tied down so very closely,
after all, and I'm to have the proper amount of
leave for recreation and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"When do you begin?"</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow, at nine in the morning."</p>

<p>"You won't be on guard duty while this other
detail lasts?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Too bad," muttered Hal. "Of course I may
be wrong, but to me the thorough study of real
guard duty is one of the most important things
in a soldier's profession."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've mastered guard duty pretty well,"
broke in Corporal Noll.</p>

<p>"Then I congratulate you," was Hal Overton's
dry rejoinder. "I feel that I'm only beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to see the real niceties of the work of
the guard."</p>

<p>"We've an hour left before the next drill,"
resumed young Corporal Terry, after glancing
at his watch. "Shall we go over and see if
Sergeant Hupner is ready to start breaking us
in at wig-wagging?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've been waiting to do," Hal
Overton rejoined.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be a bit glad over my
success in getting into telegraphy," complained
Noll.</p>

<p>"If it seemed that way, then it's because our
tongues were too busy otherwise," Hal answered.
"Noll, I congratulate you from the bottom
of my heart, for you're plumb wild to know
all about telegraphing."</p>

<p>"Only because it's of use in the military
world," explained Corporal Terry. "I wouldn't
care a straw about being a telegraph operator
in civil life."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't care about being anything else
in civil life, would you?"</p>

<p>"No," Corporal Noll admitted promptly.
"After a taste of real soldiering in the regular
Army I don't see how on earth a fellow can be
satisfied with any other kind of life. That is,
if a fellow has life, spirit and red blood in him."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner proved not only to be disengaged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
but ready to begin the instruction of
the aspiring young wig-waggers immediately.</p>

<p>It is really no part of an infantry soldier's
duty to learn telegraphy, but he is trained at
times in the use of the wig-wag signal flags.
In the Army both telegraphy and signaling are
work usually performed by members of the Signal
Corps. In the case of telegraphy, however, at
an infantry post where there is no detachment
of Signal Corps men, then the work at the telegraph
instruments must necessarily fall upon
infantry soldiers, since some of the messages
sent and received at a military post cannot be
intrusted to men who have not taken the oath.</p>

<p>"You take one of the flags, Corporal Overton,"
began Sergeant Hupner, after stepping
from barracks out into the open, "and I'll take
the other at the outset. Corporal Terry can
look on at first. Now, a signalman, at the beginning
of his work, holds the flag straight up before
him&mdash;so. Each letter in the alphabet has
its own series of numbers to stand for it. These
numbers are made by dropping the flag so many
times to the right or left of your body.
Thus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner described some rapid sweeps
with the flag to right and left.</p>

<p>"A, B, C, D, E," he spelled along, as he signaled
the letters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"We know that part of it already, Sergeant,"
replied Corporal Hal. "We've been studying
the alphabet and the punctuation points in the
book."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"Oh, I'll warrant that you've been studying
the alphabet and everything connected with it,"
replied Sergeant Hupner, with a smile. "And
I don't believe you'll need many points from
me in order to become first-class signalmen.
Take this flag, Terry. Now, Overton, stand off
there and signal your full name to me. Spell
out the letters slowly, so that I can criticize
you when necessary."</p>

<p>Despite his knowledge of the alphabet Hal
naturally made a few blunders at first.</p>

<p>"Your work lacks snap," remarked Sergeant
Hupner. "Even when you spell slowly you
should bring the flag down smartly to either side.
Like this."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner illustrated briskly with his
arms.</p>

<p>"Now send me the name of your regiment."</p>


<p>Hal did better this time.</p>

<p>"You'll soon have the hang of it," declared
the sergeant encouragingly. "Now, send me
the same thing over again, but with more
speed."</p>

<p>"Fine!" added Hupner when Hal had obeyed.
"Now, Terry, we'll try you for a few moments.
What is your full name?"</p>

<p>Noll signaled it, making each letter carefully
with the flag.</p>

<p>"Now tell me&mdash;with the flag&mdash;what you think
of to-day's weather."</p>

<p>"Fine and cool," signaled back Noll.</p>

<p>Thus the instruction continued. Each young
soldier improved a good deal during that hour.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll call it off until to-morrow," remarked
the sergeant at last, and turned to re-enter
barracks.</p>

<p>"How do you like it, Noll?" asked Overton.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," admitted boyish Corporal
Terry. "But I'd rather have telegraphy. I
don't see why you've been so wild over the
wig-wag flags."</p>

<p>"For just one reason," responded Hal
promptly. "Because it's all a part of the soldier's
life and duty. I mean to know every
phase and detail of the soldier's business that
I can possibly pick up. And I hope you won't
back out, Noll."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'll stick," agreed Corporal Terry,
though it sounded as if he promised almost reluctantly.</p>

<p>Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta! The bugler was sounding the
first call for drill. That sent the two boyish
young corporals quickly into barracks with their
signal flags, which they exchanged for their
rifles.</p>

<p>Their old friend Hyman&mdash;no longer Private
Hyman, but now, for three months, Corporal
Hyman&mdash;regarded them with indulgent eyes.</p>

<p>"You kids been out learning how to wave the
shirt?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Hal. Then, with pretended
severity, he demanded: "Do you think, Corporal
Hyman, you have chosen a respectful
enough manner in addressing other corporals
who rank you by virtue of prior appointment
to the grade?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nobody takes a corporal seriously except
the corporal himself," drawled Hyman. "A
corporal in the Army is only a small-fry boss.
He's handy to lay the blame on for things, and
he doesn't dare to 'sass' back. Neither does
the corporal dare to 'take it out of' the private
soldiers in his squad, for, if he did, the privates
would report him and have him court-martialed.
Kids, I'm growing rather tired of being a corporal.
I think I'll go to the colonel and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever Hyman was going to do he
did not explain, for the notes of assembly rang
out and all the men in the squad room hastened
outside, yet did it with that dignity and seeming
deliberation that the soldier soon acquires.</p>

<p>Drill was over in something like an hour. Hal
and Noll returned to squad room, where they
spent some little time going over their equipment.
Then they sauntered outside, for there was still
some time before the noon meal at company
mess.</p>

<p>"Look at Hyman, in that tree over yonder,"
said Hal, nodding in the direction.</p>

<p>Corporal Hyman was sitting on one of the
lower limbs of a tree some four hundred yards
away. It was close to the wall that ran along
the front of the reservation, and overlooked the
road that came up from the town of Clowdry.</p>

<p>"Yes," grinned Noll. "It's a favorite trick
with old Hyman to get up in a tree like that.
Says he can think better that way than when
he's touching common earth. Hello, he has
jumped down to the wall. There he goes into
the road outside."</p>

<p>"There was a cloud of dust along the road.
I guess he's talking to some one in a carriage or
an automobile," guessed Hal.</p>

<p>"Well, it's of no interest to us," mused Noll.</p>

<p>But in that Corporal Terry was wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's Hyman up on the wall again," reported
Hal.</p>

<p>"So I see, and he's making motions this way."</p>

<p>"He's signaling," muttered Hal, watching the
motions of Corporal Hyman's right arm. He
had started with that arm held up before his
face. Now the arm was falling <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'rythmically'">rhythmically</ins> to
left and right. "Why, Hyman is asking, 'Can
you read this?'"</p>

<p>Then, raising his own arm, Hal signaled back:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Again Hyman's right arm was moving. Hal
watched closely, spelling out the wig-wagged
signal:</p>

<p>"Pipe&mdash;off&mdash;what's&mdash;coming. Greatest&mdash;ever
happened&mdash;in the&mdash;Army. Don't&mdash;miss&mdash;it."</p>

<p>"Now, what on earth can that be?" queried
Noll.</p>

<p>"It must be something unusual to rouse enthusiasm
in a man like Hyman," laughed Hal.</p>

<p>And indeed it was something great that was
coming. Corporal Hyman's wig-wagging arm
was moving again.</p>

<p>"Hustle&mdash;over&mdash;to&mdash;main&mdash;road."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll were instantly in motion. It
must be confessed that they were eager.</p>

<p>Little did they guess that the coming event
was of a nature destined soon to have the whole
post at Fort Clowdry by the ears!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>LIEUTENANT "ALGY" JOINS THE ARMY</h3>


<div class='cap'>IN at the gate down by post number one&mdash;in
other words, at the guard house&mdash;turned
an extremely large and costly-looking
seven-passenger touring car.</div>

<p>At the driver's post sat an undersized,
shrewd-looking little Frenchman.</p>

<p>Behind him, in one of the five seats of the
tonneau sat a dapper-looking young man of
medium height, with a soft, curly little
moustache and dressed in the height of masculine
fashion.</p>

<p>At post number one the car was halted, apparently
much to the surprise of the solitary
passenger, who leaned indolently forward and
exchanged some words with the sentry.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" gasped Noll. "He must be a
person of some importance, after all. There's
the sentry presenting arms."</p>

<p>"And there comes the corporal of the guard,
making a rifle salute," added Hal. "It must
be a new officer joining the regiment."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;an officer?" gasped Noll, in unfeigned
disgust. "Don't libel the good old
Army, Hal."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Of a sudden the big car shot forward again,
and came up the main road to officers' row at
a smashing clip.</p>

<p>Then, just as suddenly, it halted beside the
two young corporals.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys!" greeted the dapper, smiling
little fellow in the tonneau. "Say, I'm afraid
I'm all at sea. I've come to live with you fellows,
but I'm blessed if I haven't already forgotten
what that fellow with the gun told me
down at the porter's lodge."</p>

<p>"Porter's lodge? Do you mean the guard
house, sir?" Hal asked respectfully.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;if that's what you call it&mdash;of
course. Names don't matter much to me.
Never did. Some one over in Washington&mdash;the
secretary of something or other&mdash;sent me
over here. I'm a new lieutenant, and I believe
I'm to stay at this beastly place."</p>

<p>At the mention of the word "lieutenant" both
Hal and Noll came to a very formal salute.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you mean by that?" smiled
the new-comer affably. "Sign of some lodge
on the post? I haven't had time to get into
any of your secret societies yet, of course."</p>

<p>"We offered you the officer's salute, sir," explained
Corporal Hal.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you're officers? I guessed as
much," beamed the pleasant young stranger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; we're corporals, sir," Hal informed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; seems to me I've heard about corporals.
I'll know more about them later, I dare
say. How are you, anyway, boys?"</p>

<p>The stranger leaned out over the side of the
car, extending his hand to Corporal Overton,
who could not very well refuse it. Then Noll
came in for a handshake.</p>

<p>"Of course you understand sir, that we're
below the grade of officers," Hal continued.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" replied the still smiling
stranger. "Such things as that don't count.
And I've been warned that the Army is one of
the most democratic places in the world. I
haven't brought any of my 'lugs' here with
me&mdash;'pon my word I haven't. I'm Lieutenant
Algernon Ferrers. I hope all of you fellows
will soon like me well enough to call me Algy."</p>

<p>Though Mr. Ferrers was certainly the biggest
joke in the way of an officer that either of
the young soldiers had ever seen, it was impossible
not to like this pleasant young man.</p>

<p>"Jump in&mdash;won't you, boys?" invited Lieutenant
Ferrers, throwing the nearer door of the
tonneau open. "I'll be tremendously obliged
if you'll pilot me to the right place. Where
do I ring the bell? Of course I've got to give
some one here the glad hand before I can be
shown to my rooms."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Though they did so with some misgivings Hal
and Noll both stepped into the tonneau.</p>

<p>"Sit right down, boys," urged Lieutenant
Ferrers amiably.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," explained Hal Overton.
"It would be a bad breach of discipline in this
regiment for any enlisted man to sit in the company
of his officers."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're enlisted men, eh?" queried the
new lieutenant, showing no signs whatever of
feeling taken aback. "I'm glad to say I didn't
have to enlist. My guv'nor has some good
friends at Washington, and I was appointed
from civil life."</p>

<p>Hal and Noll had already guessed that much
without difficulty. No officer quite like Lieutenant
Ferrers had ever been turned out at West
Point, and surely such a man had never risen
from the ranks. Now, when all the West Point
graduates have been commissioned into the
Army, and all meritorious enlisted men have
been promoted to second lieutenancies, then, if
there be any vacancies left, the President fills
these vacancies in the rank of second lieutenant,
by appointing young men from civil life.</p>

<p>Generally these appointments from civil life
go to the honor graduates of colleges where
military drill is conducted by an officer of the
Army detailed as instructor. But, occasionally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
there are more vacancies than these honor graduates
can or will fill&mdash;and then political influence
very often plays a part in the appointment
of some young men as lieutenants in the Army.</p>

<p>"Tell Fran&ccedil;ois where to drive, will you?"
begged Lieutenant Ferrers.</p>

<p>"I don't believe, sir, that Colonel North is at
his office so late in the forenoon," Corporal Hal
replied. "But I think, sir, that Captain Hale,
the regimental adjutant, will be found there."</p>

<p>"Does Hale assign a fellow's rooms to him?"
queried Lieutenant Ferrers innocently.</p>

<p>"If you are under orders to join, sir, you
will be expected to report to Colonel North, or
else to the regimental adjutant, who represents
the colonel."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;see," nodded the new lieutenant slowly.
"Will you do me the extreme favor to tell Fran&ccedil;ois
where to leave us?"</p>

<p>Hal leaned forward, indicating the headquarters
building.</p>

<p>In another moment the big car stopped before
headquarters.</p>

<p>"Come right on in, fellows, and introduce me,
won't you?" urged Lieutenant Ferrers.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am afraid we'd better not," replied
Hal, flushing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see&mdash;you've a luncheon appointment,
or something of the sort, eh? Well, never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mind; glad to have met you. Expect to have
many a good time with you later on. Good fellows,
both of you, I'll wager."</p>

<p>"Come away from here, Noll," begged Hal,
as soon as Mr. Ferrers had run up the steps and
into the building. "I'm suffocating."</p>

<p>"I'm green," grinned Noll chokingly, "but
I'd hate to have as much ahead of me to learn
as that new officer has."</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps he was joshing us," suggested
Hal.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I think," responded Noll, struggling hard
to keep his gravity, "that Mr. Ferrers is kidding
himself worse than any one else."</p>

<p>In the meantime Ferrers had bounded past
an orderly and had broken into the office of
the regimental adjutant.</p>

<p>"Hello, old chap!" was his joyous greeting
of dignified Captain Hale.</p>

<p>"Sir?" demanded the regimental adjutant.
"Who the blazes are you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Name's Ferrers, old chap," responded the
newcomer, lightly, dropping a card down on
the adjutant's desk.</p>

<p>Captain Hale glanced at the card. Then a
light seemed to dawn on him.</p>

<p>"Oh! I think it likely you are the Lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Ferrers who has been ordered to the Thirty-fourth,"
went on Captain Hale.</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful guesser, old chap.
Now, where do I go to see about my rooms,
housing my servants, storing my cars, etc.?"</p>

<p>Captain Hale tried to hide his grim smile
as he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the Thirty-fourth, Mr. Ferrers.
And now I think I had better take you to
Colonel North. He has been expecting you."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Algernon Ferrers followed the
broad-backed adjutant into an inner office,
where the very young man was presented to
the grizzled-gray Colonel North. Then, as
quickly as he could, Captain Hale escaped back
to his desk in the outer office.</p>

<p>Colonel North looked at Mr. Ferrers with a
glance that did not convey absolute approval.</p>

<p>"Have you been in a train wreck, Mr. Ferrers?"
inquired the colonel.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no. Do I look as bad as that?"
inquired the new lieutenant, with a downward
glance at his faultless attire.</p>

<p>"But you were due to arrive here at four
o'clock yesterday afternoon, Mr. Ferrers," continued
the colonel. "I was here at my desk,
waiting to receive you."</p>

<p>"I hope I didn't inconvenience you any,"
murmured Ferrers. "You see, Colonel, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
I got in at Pueblo I ran across some old friends
at the station. They insisted on my staying
over with them for half a day. I couldn't very
well get out of it, you see."</p>

<p>"Couldn't very well get out of it?" repeated
Colonel North distinctly and coldly. "Wouldn't
it have been enough, Mr. Ferrers, to have told
your friends that you were under orders to be
here at four o'clock yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, now," murmured Mr. Ferrers,
"I hope you're not going to raise any beastly
row about it."</p>

<p>"That is not language to use to your superior
officer, Mr. Ferrers!"</p>

<p>"Then you have my instant apology,
Colonel," protested the young man. "But, you
see, these were very important people that I
met&mdash;the Porter-Stanleys, of New York. Very
likely you have met them."</p>

<p>Colonel North now found it hard to repress
a tendency to laugh. But he choked it back.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Ferrers, you do not realize
the seriousness of failing to obey a military order
punctually. More than that, I fear it would
take more time than I have between now and
luncheon to make it plain to you. But I assure
you that you have a great deal, a very
great deal, to learn about the strict requirements
of Army life and conduct."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you'll find me very keen to learn, sir,
very keen, I assure you. But, since you're good
enough to postpone telling me more about such
little matters, may I ask you, Colonel, who will
show me to my rooms? I shall need quite a
few, for, outside of two chauffeurs&mdash;I have five
auto cars you know&mdash;I have also four household
servants and a valet."</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;what!" gasped Colonel North.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferrers patiently repeated the details
concerning the number of his automobiles and
servants.</p>

<p>"And where are they?" demanded the regimental
commander.</p>

<p>"I left them over in Clowdry until I send
for them, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferrers, have you any idea how many
rooms an unmarried second lieutenant has?"</p>

<p>"A dozen or fifteen, I hope," suggested Mr.
Ferrers hopefully. "A gentleman, of course,
can't live in fewer rooms."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferrers, an unmarried second lieutenant
lives in bachelor officers' quarters. He has
a parlor, bed-room and bath."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say now," protested poor Mr. Ferrers
earnestly, "you can't expect me to get along
in any such dog-kennel of a place."</p>

<p>"You'll have to, Mr. Ferrers."</p>

<p>"But my servants&mdash;my chauffeurs?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"No room for them on this post."</p>

<p>"But I can't keep five cars running without at
least two chauffeurs. And by the way, Colonel,
what kind of a garage do you have here?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, Mr. Ferrers. You can keep
one small car down at the quartermaster's
stables, but that is the best you can do."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Algernon Ferrers, who instantly
realized that this fine-looking old colonel was
not making game of him, sat back staring, a
picture of hopeless dejection.</p>

<p>"I had no idea the Army was anything like
as beastly as this," he murmured disconsolately.</p>

<p>"If you're going to remain in the service, Mr.
Ferrers," returned the colonel, "I'm afraid you
will have to recast many of your ideas. In the
first place, you won't need servants. You'll get
your meals at the officers' mess, and all the servants
needed there are provided."</p>

<p>"But I must have some one to take care of
even my two poor little rooms," fidgeted Mr.
Ferrers. "I can't undertake to do that myself.
Besides, Colonel, I don't know how to do housework."</p>

<p>"Some of the work in your rooms you should
and must do yourself," explained Colonel North.
"Such, for example, as tidying up your quarters.
The rougher work you can have done by
a striker."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Striker!" echoed Mr. Ferrers, a gleam of
intelligence coming into his eyes. "No, thank
you, Colonel. Strikers never work. I've heard
my guv'nor talk about strikes in his business."</p>

<p>"'Striker,'" explained Colonel North, "is
Army slang. Your 'striker' is a private soldier,
whom you hire at so many a dollars a month to
do the rougher work in your quarters. You
make whatever bargain you choose with the
soldier. At this post the bachelor officers usually
pay a striker eight dollars a month."</p>

<p>"At that price I can afford a lot of 'em," responded
Mr. Ferrers, brightening considerably.</p>

<p>"An unmarried officer is not allowed to have
more than one striker in this regiment," said
the colonel, whereat Ferrer's face showed his
dismay. "Nor is any soldier obliged to become
your striker. You cannot engage him unless
the soldier is wholly willing. However, a good
many men like the extra pay. You will be assigned
to A company. Direct the first sergeant
of that company to send you a man who is
willing to serve as a striker. And now, Mr.
Ferrers, as you appear to be wholly ignorant of
Army life I think I will give you a mentor."</p>

<p>Turning to the telephone Colonel North
called:</p>

<p>"Connect me with Lieutenant Prescott.
Hello, is that you, Mr. Prescott? The regimental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
commander is speaking. My compliments,
Mr. Prescott, and can you come over to
headquarters? Thank you."</p>

<p>Ringing off the colonel turned to his very
new young lieutenant, saying:</p>

<p>"Mr. Prescott is a last year's graduate of the
Military Academy at West Point, and one of
the most capable younger officers I have ever
met. I can think of no man so well qualified to
coach you in the start of your new life, Mr. Ferrers.
You have some baggage with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. Two trunks on the car."</p>

<p>"Then you have uniforms with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Say 'sir' when answering a superior officer."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You have your two regulation swords?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And say!" Ferrers beamed forth,
with enthusiasm, while his eyes lit up. "The
regulation swords are not such a much, so, while
I got them, I also had four other swords made
that are a whole lot handsomer. Wait until you
see me, sir, with the beauty that Tiffany made
to my order&mdash;my own design, sir."</p>

<p>"Doubtless your extra swords will do very
well as ornaments in your quarters, Mr. Ferrers,"
replied the colonel, trying very hard to
keep a straight face. "But you will not appear
with any other than the regulation swords."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I say, now&mdash;&mdash;" broke forth Ferrers
anxiously, but the door opened, and Lieutenant
Dick Prescott strode in, looking the perfection
of handsome soldiery.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, sir?" Prescott asked, coming
to a very formal salute.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Prescott. This young gentleman
is Lieutenant Algernon Ferrers, lately appointed
from civil life. As Mr. Ferrers will
presently be glad to admit that he knows less
than nothing about Army life, I can think of
no one better qualified than you, Mr. Prescott,
to explain to him the nature of military life."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Colonel," replied Prescott
gravely.</p>

<p>"Kindly take Mr. Ferrers over to the officers'
mess and see that he is made to feel at home
among you youngsters. And advise him, in all
necessary respects, as to what is expected of him
in this regiment."</p>

<p>"But my rooms, sir? My little dog-kennel?"
urged Ferrers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Prescott will take you to Lieutenant
Pope, the battalion quartermaster, who will assign
you to quarters. And, Mr. Prescott, make
it a point to introduce Mr. Ferrers to Major
Silsbee and also Captain Ruggles of A company,
for Mr. Ferrers is assigned to that company."</p>

<p>Prescott saluted smartly in leaving his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
colonel. Ferrers also endeavored to salute,
and imitated badly&mdash;with the wrong hand.</p>

<p>As soon as the door had closed Colonel North
rose, sighed and muttered:</p>

<p>"With a seeming idiot like that on officers'
row I can see our old and happy life here passing."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ferrers, after an infinite amount
of coaching by Mr. Prescott, turned out at afternoon
parade. Ferrers did not take his post with
his company, but stood at one side, out of the
way, watching the work with a rather bored
look.</p>

<p>By the time that the men were dismissed from
parade every enlisted man in barracks appeared
to have heard a lot about Lieutenant Ferrers.
Every man was either telling or listening to
some anecdote about the new young officer, and
roars of laughter rang on all sides, for Algy
Ferrers, during the brief afternoon, had managed,
in spite of Prescott, to make a whole lot
of ridiculous breaks.</p>

<p>"That young shave-tail won't last two weeks
in the service," predicted Corporal Hyman,
who, though he now belonged in another squad
room, was just now visiting with Sergeant Hupner's
men.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Noll answered thoughtfully.
"I've seen a lot of worse enlisted men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
licked into shape and become good soldiers. I
don't know why the rule shouldn't work as well
with a new officer."</p>

<p>Corporal Hal, at this moment, was down at
the further end of the squad room, close to an
open window. Here, where he had plenty of
space for man&oelig;uvring, he was practising some
moves with the signal flag, while Sergeant
Hupner stood by criticising.</p>

<p>"Of all the dizzy young rookies with the waving
shirt I consider you the worst," jeered Corporal
Hyman, stepping over. "Here, I'm going
to take that thing away from you. What you
need, Overton, is rest."</p>

<p>Hyman made a dive for the signal flag.
Corporal Hal resisted the effort to take it away
from him, and a good-natured scuffle followed.
While it was going on Hal was forced into the
open window.</p>

<p>Hyman seized the staff, giving it a twist.
Then Hal started to recover it.</p>

<p>Thus the staff dropped and fell below, just
as young Corporal Overton sprang inward.</p>

<p>Instantly, however, the boy remembered that
it might drop on some one's head. He wheeled
like a flash, bending out of the window, just as
a howl floated upward.</p>

<p>"Hey, you idiot!" followed the howl, and the
young corporal saw Hinkey, a new recruit in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the regiment and company, take off his hat and
rub a rising lump on the top of his head.</p>

<p>"Look out below, there!" called Corporal
Hal.</p>

<p>"What else are you going to throw out at
me?" glared Private Hinkey.</p>

<p>For answer, Corporal Hal sprang over the
window sill, landing lightly on the ground below.</p>

<p>"Hinkey, I'm mighty sorry," began Overton.
"It was an accident, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An accident?" flared Hinkey sulkily. "I
suppose you expect me to believe that you
slammed that flagstaff down and hit me on the
top of the head, and that it was all an accident?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do expect you to believe it," replied
Corporal Hal, his face flushing.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," came the ugly response, accompanied
by another scowl. "It's a lie,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Hinkey!" warned Corporal
Overton, his fine young face paling slightly.
"Passing the lie, you know, don't go in the
Army!"</p>

<p>"I don't care a hang what goes in the Army,"
snarled the private, who was a man some
twenty-eight years of age, dark of complexion
and forbidding of feature. "You've had it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for me all along, Corporal Overton. Only yesterday
morning you scorched me at drill."</p>

<p>"You needed it," was the quiet reply. "And
I used no abusive language."</p>

<p>"Good thing you didn't," flashed Hinkey.
"And the day before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop your whining and let me look at your
head," advised Corporal Overton. "Whew,
what a bump! Hinkey, I'm truly sor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get away from me, and never mind my
head," snapped the other.</p>

<p>"But man, the flesh is cut, and the bump is
already the size of a hen's egg, and growing.
You must have that attended to at hospital."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I please about that," retorted
Hinkey.</p>

<p>"No; you'll do as you're told. You will report
to First Sergeant Gray at once, and ask his
permission to report at hospital without delay."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think I will," came the disagreeable
retort.</p>

<p>"I know you will," said Corporal Overton
more sternly, "for it's a military order and you
have no choice but to obey. And, if you think
I did that purposely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think, Overton. I know you did."</p>

<p>"Then I'll post you as to your rights in the
matter, Private Hinkey. When you report to
Sergeant Gray for hospital permission, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you will do at once, you can also state that you
believe I assaulted you purposely. Then Sergeant
Gray will arrange for you to go to Captain
Cortland and make regular complaint
against me."</p>

<p>"You think I'm a fool, don't you?" jeered
Hinkey.</p>

<p>"On that point I decline to commit myself."</p>

<p>"Fine to go and complain against an officers'
pet and boot-lick," laughed Hinkey sullenly.
"No, sir! I'll go to no officer with a charge
against a favored boot-lick!"</p>

<p>"That's the only way in which you can get
redress."</p>

<p>"Is it?" demanded Private Hinkey, with a
sudden, intense scowl that made his ill-featured
face look satanic. "Well, you wait and see,
my fine young buck doughboy!"</p>

<p>"Don't fail to report to Sergeant Gray for
hospital permission," Corporal Hal Overton
called after the fellow. "If you do, you'll be
up against disobedience of orders."</p>

<p>Private Hinkey, moving away, made a derisive
gesture behind his back, but the boyish
young corporal turned on his heel, stepping off
in another direction.</p>

<p>"If that kid thinks he can lord it over me,"
snarled Private Hinkey under his breath, "he's
due to wake up before long."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless Private Hinkey had already
learned enough of Army life to feel certain that
he was obliged to go to Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Go over to hospital and have
that head dressed at once," ordered the first
sergeant. "How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"The fellow who did it said it was an accident,"
replied Hinkey, with an ugly leer.</p>

<p>"Then report him," urged the first sergeant
of B Company. "I can take care of the offender
if it was done on purpose."</p>

<p>"That's all right," snapped Private Hinkey.
"So can I."</p>

<p>"If Hinkey is telling the truth, then there's
the start of a nice little row in that sore head,"
thought Gray, glancing after the man headed
for hospital.</p>

<p>And, indeed, Sergeant Gray was wholly right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST BREATH AGAINST A SOLDIER'S HONOR</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE night was so quiet, the air so still, that
the single, distant stroke of the town
clock bell over in the town of Clowdry
was distinctly audible.</div>

<p>Dong! boomed the bell, the vibration reaching
the ears of two or three of the lighter sleepers,
and causing them to stir lightly in their sleep
in Sergeant Hupner's squad room.</p>

<p>Out on the post, not far away, a dog chose
to bark at that town-clock bell.</p>

<p>Some one gliding swiftly through the squad
room upset a stool with a loud crash. Yet few
of the soundly sleeping soldiers bothered their
heads about such a series of trivial noises.</p>

<p>Now, a series of hails began, starting down
at the guard house and running rapidly around
the sentry posts until the sentry pacing near
barracks caught it up and called lustily:</p>

<p>"Post number six. One o'clock, and all's
well!"</p>

<p>One man in especial had been stirring on his
cot as though trying to throw off some phantom
of dread. Now instantly after the sentry's hail
this stirring sleeper emitted an excited yell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wow! Turn out the guard&mdash;post number
six!"</p>

<p>Instantly Sergeant Hupner awoke, sitting up
on his cot.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you idiot?"
growled the disturbed sergeant.</p>

<p>"I've been touched!" wailed the excited
voice.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Private William Green,
the joke of the squad room, the man who hoarded
his money and carried much of it about with
him.</p>

<p>"Go to sleep, William," ordered the sergeant
in a more soothing voice. "I've often told you
that one so young shouldn't drink coffee at supper."</p>

<p>"I've been touched, I tell you!" insisted William
Green, now out of his bed and feeling with
frantic hands under the head of the mattress.
"Don't I know? I tell you, my buckskin pouch
is gone. Some one was in this room and got
it!"</p>

<p>In a jiffy Sergeant Hupner was out of bed.
His groping right hand found the switch and
turned on the electric lights. Then Hupner
jumped for his uniform trousers and drew them
on.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, squad room?" called the
voice of the alert sentry outside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hupner first went to the door of the
squad room, locked it and dropped the key in
his trousers' pocket. Then the sergeant ran to
an open window.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it's anything worse than a
nightmare of one of the men, sentry. Don't call
the guard until I look about a bit."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Then Hupner turned to the cot of Corporal
Hal Overton, which was close to the window.</p>

<p>"Why, Corporal, what ails you?" demanded
the sergeant. "You're shaking and your face
has a frightened look."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have just awakened from a pretty bad
dream," Corporal Hal replied sheepishly. "I'll
be over it at once."</p>

<p>"Turn out, Corporal, and you also, Corporal
Terry. We've got to investigate in this room."</p>

<p>Hal instantly thrust a leg out. Something
dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>"Ow!" wailed Private Green. "It wasn't a
dream, after all. I knew it would go off."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner, bending low like a flash,
now picked up a revolver from the floor beside
Hal's cot, while Hal himself sat up, staring
rather dazedly at the weapon.</p>

<p>"How did this come to be in your bed, Corporal
Overton?" demanded the sergeant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"But it was in your bed. You shook it out
when you went to get up just now."</p>

<p>"That's the gun," insisted Private William
Green. "I saw it poked into my face by some
one prowling before my cot."</p>

<p>"Were you so scared that you didn't dare
jump up or say anything?" demanded Hupner,
turning upon Private Green, who had now
reached the vicinity of Hal's cot.</p>

<p>"Scared, nothing!" grunted Private William.
"I thought I must be dreaming, for there was
no danger in this room. Then I heard something
go smash down the room, like a stool being
tipped over, and then I came altogether out of
my doze, and time I did, too! For I put my
hand under the mattress and my pouch and
money were gone. Whoever poked that gun
toward my head got my money!"</p>

<p>By this time more than half the men in the
room were sitting up on the edges of their cots.
A few more lay still, though wide awake, while
a few of the hardest sleepers were still in the
Land of Nod.</p>

<p>"Green, are you sure your money's gone?"
insisted Hupner sternly. It was no light thing
to the reliable old sergeant to find that he had
a thief in his squad room.</p>

<p>"Come and look for yourself, Sergeant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Corporals Overton and Terry, dress yourselves,"
ordered the sergeant, as he started after
Private William Green. "The rest of you
men needn't dress unless I direct it."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Sergeant," insisted Green,
after pulling the mattress bodily from his cot.
"Do you see anything that looks like my buckskin
pouch?"</p>

<p>There was no pouch to be found on or near
Soldier William's cot.</p>

<p>"How much money did you have in the
pouch?" demanded Hupner almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and ten dollars," declared
Green promptly.</p>

<p>"Whew!"</p>

<p>To most of the soldiers present that much
money represented a fortune.</p>

<p>Yet no one in the room thought of doubting
William's assertion. As readers of the preceding
volume know, Green had had considerable money
when he joined the regiment something more
than a year earlier. And William was known
to be one who was constantly adding to his
money by saving his pay.</p>

<p>Moreover, Private Green had made not a little
by lending money to comrades in the battalion.
He loaned on the time-honored system
of lending among enlisted men in the Army&mdash;the
system of "five now but six on pay day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>There are soldiers in every company&mdash;in every
squad room&mdash;who always spend their pay within
a few days after receiving it from the paymaster.
As soon as his money is gone, and he needs or
wants more, the improvident soldier turns to
some comrade who saves and lends his money.
The loan is five dollars, but by all the traditions
the borrower must return six on pay day.</p>

<p>William Green had been making money on
this plan. Some of his wealth Green now had
on deposit at a Denver bank, but much of his
"pile" he always insisted on carrying with him.</p>

<p>And usually this is a safe enough plan. In
no body of men in the world does honesty average
higher than among the soldiers of the American
regular Army.</p>

<p>Once in a while, of course, an exceptional
"black sheep" may get in even among soldiers,
and William had often been warned not to keep
so much convertible wealth about his person.
But William trusted his comrades and carried
large sums of cash.</p>

<p>"Corporal Overton, you take one side of the
room, and Corporal Terry the other. Scan the
floor for any sign of a buckskin pouch."</p>

<p>"Let me help," begged William.</p>

<p>"All right," nodded Sergeant Hupner. "And
look, also, for any stool that may be overturned."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The search was unavailing. No sight was
gained of the buckskin pouch, while every stool
in the room was upright and in place.</p>

<p>"Does any man here know anything about
Green's buckskin?" demanded Hupner.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Crossing to the window, Sergeant Hupner
called:</p>

<p>"Sentry, call the corporal of the guard."</p>

<p>Almost immediately the corporal of the guard
was at hand. Sergeant Hupner informed him
that there had probably been a robbery in the
squad room and stated the known circumstances
briefly.</p>

<p>Corporal Jason immediately sent a member
of the guard to arouse the officer of the day and
ask him to come to the squad room.</p>

<p>Soon after Lieutenant Greg Holmes strode
into the room, his sword clanking at his side.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Holmes heard Sergeant Hupner's
report, which was but a short one.</p>

<p>Then the young officer of the day turned to
Corporal Hal, eyeing him keenly.</p>

<p>"Corporal Overton, isn't there something you
can tell me about this? You were found awake,
shaking somewhat and with an alarmed look
on your face."</p>

<p>"That is true, sir," Hal Overton admitted.</p>

<p>"When Sergeant Hupner directed you to rise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
you did so, and at the same time kicked out of
your bed this revolver, which was discharged."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Corporal," continued Lieutenant Holmes,
"it would look as though you must have some
knowledge of the affair. Bear in mind that I
am not making any charge against you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I should hope not, sir," stammered Hal
Overton, his face growing very pallid.</p>

<p>"What do you know about this matter, Corporal
Overton?" pressed the young officer.</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing, sir, more than Sergeant
Hupner has already stated to you, sir.
My condition of apparent fright was due to a
bad dream from which I was at the moment
waking."</p>

<p>"And you know nothing whatever regarding
the robbery from Private Green?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing more than the rest, sir,"
insisted Hal, though his color continued to rise.</p>

<p>The young soldier felt that he was half suspected,
and he felt all the awkwardness of innocence&mdash;an
awkwardness that real guilt seldom
displays.</p>

<p>"Men," it was Sergeant Hupner's voice
breaking the stillness now, "if you each want
to clear your own individual selves you will step
forward and volunteer to have your persons
and your belongings searched."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly the men moved forward, and Lieutenant
Holmes glanced away from Hal Overton.
The lieutenant's survey of the lad's face had
not been in the least accusing, but merely a keen
look of inquiry.</p>

<p>"All the men in the room have come forward
and are willing to be searched, sir," reported
the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Good enough, Sergeant, since they volunteer,
but I would not have them forced without
an order from the post commander. Sergeant,
will you undertake the search?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; shall I have the corporals assist
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant, and I will lend a general
oversight at the same time."</p>

<p>That search occupied some forty minutes.
Not only were the persons of the men searched,
but their chests and all their belongings. Hupner
and his two boyish young corporals asked
Lieutenant Holmes to search them himself, which
the officer of the day did.</p>

<p>"There doesn't appear to be a chance that
Private Green's money is in this room, or in
the possession of any man in the room," remarked
Lieutenant Holmes at last. "Green, you
should have taken sensible advice and deposited
your money, either with the paymaster or at a
bank."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall, sir, if I ever get it back," replied
William Green mournfully.</p>

<p>"Well, there appears to be nothing more that
I can do," continued Lieutenant Holmes.
"However, I will return to the guard house and
call up the commanding officer over the telephone,
reporting the matter. Let your men go
to bed, Sergeant, but you will remain up until
either I return or send you some word through
the corporal of the guard."</p>

<p>After the officer of the day had gone out,
the men of the squad room looked from one to
another in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"If any fellow took my money for a joke,"
announced Private William Green, "I'll call
it all off if he'll be kind enough to return it."</p>

<p>No one accepted the offer.</p>

<p>"It's gone, all right, Green, evidently, and
serves you right," said Sergeant Hupner gruffly.</p>

<p>In the course of a few minutes the corporal
of the guard came back to inform Sergeant Hupner
that a guard would be set, both in the corridor
and outside, to prevent any man from leaving
this squad room during the night. In the
morning, immediately following first call to reveille,
Colonel North, his adjutant and the officer
of the day would visit the squad room together.</p>

<p>"And that's all there is to it, for to-night,
men," announced Sergeant Hupner. "Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
man in bed now, for I'm going to switch off the
light."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later some of the soldiers were
asleep, but not all, for presently Hupner's
strong military voice boomed through the room:</p>

<p>"Stop that whispering! Silence until first
call goes in the morning."</p>

<p>After first call to reveille did sound in the
morning barely sixty seconds passed when the
door was opened to Colonel North and the two
officers accompanying him.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, there was a thorough examination.
Each man in the room was questioned
keenly by the colonel himself.</p>

<p>"Corporal Overton, how do you account for
that revolver being in your bed?"</p>

<p>Colonel North held up the weapon. It was an
ordinary service revolver, such as is worn by
an orderly when on duty without rifle, and there
were many such revolvers in barracks. No soldier
was supposed to have one of these revolvers,
except by orders, yet it would be easy
enough for any soldier to get one by stealth.</p>

<p>"I can't account for it, sir," Hal answered.
"I didn't have it myself, or put it in the bed,
and I can only guess that some one else did."</p>

<p>"Why should any one else do that, Corporal?"</p>

<p>"Possibly, sir, with a view to making me appear
guilty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suspect any one in particular?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I can't imagine why any man in
the room, or in the battalion, should want to
do it."</p>

<p>"You understand, Corporal Overton, that you
are not under any charge, or even suspicion, of
guilt in the matter," continued the commanding
officer, for Hal in truth was esteemed much too
fine a young soldier to be suspected by his officers
in the present case.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," Hal replied.</p>

<p>The inquiry was soon over and proved as resultless
as that made alone by Lieutenant Greg
Holmes in the middle of the night. The officers
left and the men prepared to hasten out for
breakfast formation.</p>

<p>"I never thought Overton would do a trick
like that," remarked a low voice behind the
young corporal, but Hal heard it.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't tell. Sometimes these quiet
fellows are the worst. Still waters run deep,
you know."</p>

<p>"I suppose other fellows in the squad room
are thinking the same," thought Hal, his heart
throbbing with pain.</p>

<p>He more than half guessed the truth&mdash;that
the seed of suspicion against him was already
sown&mdash;that henceforth he would be watched
by nearly all eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>LIEUTENANT ALGY'S INSPIRATION</h3>


<div class='cap'>LIEUTENANT ALGY FERRERS, the
picture of dejection, sat staring across
his rather tiny parlor in bachelor quarters
at smiling Lieutenant Prescott.</div>

<p>"I thought the Army was a place for gentlemen,"
murmured Algy aghast.</p>

<p>"At last accounts it was, and I believe still
is," replied the West Pointer, with a smile.</p>

<p>"But consider that beastly schedule of the
day's work that you've been explaining to me!"</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?" asked Lieutenant
Prescott patiently.</p>

<p>"What's first&mdash;what did you call it?"</p>

<p>"First call to reveille, at 5.50 in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what an utterly impossible time for
any gentleman to be out of bed. Unless," added
Algy with a sudden bright thought, "he stays
up until then, and goes to bed after the beastly
row is over."</p>

<p>"That would hardly do, I'm afraid," Lieutenant
Prescott laughed softly. "You see, the
day is full of duties. Now, sharp at six the
march&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"March? At six in the morning?" gasped
Algy Ferrers, his despair increasing by leaps
and bounds. "Man alive, I wouldn't feel like
crawling&mdash;at that time!"</p>

<p>"The term has confused you," replied Prescott.
"It's the musician of the guard&mdash;the
bugler&mdash;who plays the march. It's a strain that
is played, the first note beginning just as the
reveille gun is fired, at the minute of six in the
morning. Then, just five minutes later reveille
itself is blown."</p>

<p>"All that racket will wake me up mornings,"
complained Algy sadly.</p>

<p>"It ought to, for it's an officer's business to
be up by that time."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" groaned Algy. "Say, 'pon
my word, I'll hate to have any soldiers see me
when I'm looking as seedy as I'll look at that
time of the day."</p>

<p>"You won't see them immediately," Prescott
replied.</p>

<p>"Don't I have to go to my men as soon as
I'm up?"</p>

<p>"No; officers don't go down to barracks to
see their men rise. Now, listen. Reveille sounds
at 6.05, with assembly and roll-call right afterward.
There's a very brief athletic drill, followed
by recall from the drill at 6.15 o'clock.
At 6.20 mess call for breakfast is sounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Right after breakfast comes police of quarters
and premises. 'Police' is the Army term for
cleaning up and making everything tidy. Then,
just at 7 o'clock the bugler of the guard sounds
sick call. The first sergeant of each company
makes up the sick report, and a corporal marches
the men out who need the doctor&mdash;the 'rain-maker,'
we call him in the Army. Now, with
all that happens up to this time the non-commissioned
officers&mdash;sergeants and corporals&mdash;have
to do."</p>

<p>"Then I can sleep a little later, can't I?"
proposed Lieutenant Ferrers hopefully.</p>

<p>"If you do you'll be sure to get yourself in
a scrape. You'll be coming out of your quarters
unshaven, or with your uniform put on too
hastily. Colonel North is a true Tartar with any
officer who doesn't start the day looking like
bandbox goods. And, my dear fellow, it's no
greater hardship for you to be up early than
it is for the enlisted man. Now, at 7.10 in the
morning comes first call to drill. Drill assembly
goes at 7.20."</p>

<p>"Do I have to be there?"</p>

<p>"You do, unless excused for some very grave
reason. Recall from drill sounds at 8.20."</p>

<p>"That means that drill is over, then?" sighed
Algy questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Then, at 8.30, is fatigue call."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be properly fatigued by that time,
no doubt," confessed Algy wretchedly.</p>

<p>"You'll soon understand what 'fatigue' is in
the Army," smiled Lieutenant Prescott. "It's
more work, but work that is done without arms."</p>

<p>"Without arms? With the feet, then?"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott bit his lip, but answered:</p>

<p>"By arms this time I mean weapons. First
call to guard mounting comes at 8.50, and guard
mounting assembly at 9. At 10 another drill
begins; at 11 the recall sounds, with recall
from fatigue at 11.30. Mess call for enlisted
men is at noon, and 1 p. m. fatigue call. Drill
call goes again at 1.50, with drill assembly at
2 o'clock. The time spent at these drills varies
according to the nature of the work and the
orders. Recall from fatigue sounds at 5 o'clock.
Parade assembly is at 5.30 at this time of the
year, with retreat and evening gun-fire at 6.10.
Then comes mess call to supper. With that
ends, usually, the working day of the enlisted
man. Tattoo sounds at 9 in the evening, with
call to quarters at 10.45, and taps, or lights out,
at 11 p. m. Except when on guard or special
duty you're not likely to have to be with your
men much after retreat."</p>

<p>"Oh, I should hope not," exclaimed Algy
Ferrers fervently. "By supper time I can see
myself a nervous wreck."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get used to it," laughed Prescott.
"The rest of us all had to."</p>

<p>"And at all of those beastly things and jobs
you enumerated, Prescott, I've got to be present
and actually do a lot of work?"</p>

<p>"A big lot of work, you'll find."</p>

<p>"And yet they call being an officer in the Army
a gentleman's life."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Prescott, his eyes opening
rather wide. "Don't you consider that one may
be a gentleman and yet be industrious?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon so," sighed Algy Ferrers.
"But it all seems a beastly grind."</p>

<p>"Then how did your ever come to think of
going into the Army?"</p>

<p>"I didn't," almost flared up Algy. "It was
the guv'nor. He forced me into it. Said he'd
cut my allowance off altogether, and leave me
out of his will if I didn't get to work. And he
chose the Army for me, and put the whole thing
through. Wasn't it beastly of the guv'nor?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that it was," smiled Lieutenant
Prescott. "Of course it was different
with me. My father worked, and had to, or
starve. It was the same with me, which may
be why I can look upon the idea of a lot of work
without feeling insulted by fate. But I reckon,
Ferrers, that no man is worth his salt in the
world unless he does work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the day after Algy's arrival.
Colonel North and Major Silsbee had not yet
put the new young officer actually at work.
They had allowed him this time of grace to
get settled in his new quarters, and to talk over
his new duties with young Prescott.</p>

<p>"I can never remember all that long list of
things you told me, dear fellow," complained
Algy. "Won't you do me a great, big favor?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Write down for me that&mdash;er&mdash;time table you
laid down for me."</p>

<p>"No." Lieutenant Prescott's tone was almost
abrupt. "I'll repeat it to you, Ferrers, and you
can write it down for yourself. Get a pencil and
paper."</p>

<p>"Give me just time for a cigarette before I
take up such exhausting literary work," begged
Algy, reaching for his gold cigarette case.
"Have one, dear fellow?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Ferrers. I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"Then what do you do with your time?"</p>

<p>"Work!"</p>

<p>"What beastly old rot the Army is!" murmured
Algy, lying back in his easy chair and
blowing a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>Rap-tap! sounded at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," called Algy. It was Lieutenant
Holmes who entered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Howdy-do, Ferrers?" he hailed the new officer.
"I heard Prescott was here and came to
find him. You'll pardon me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to pardon," murmured Algy.</p>

<p>"Old ramrod," began Lieutenant Holmes,
turning to his chum and addressing him by the
old West Point nickname, "I came to see you
about your pet. He seems to be in increasing
trouble."</p>

<p>"Who's my pet!" demanded Prescott in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Corporal Overton, of your company."</p>

<p>"Corporal Overton is not my pet, and you'll
greatly oblige me by not referring to him again
in that fashion, Holmesy," returned the young
lieutenant almost stiffly. "Corporal Overton is
a mighty fine young soldier, and a good soldier
never needs to be his officer's pet; he can stand
on his own merits. But what's the trouble with
Overton? Is he still absurdly suspected of relieving
that simpleton Green of his money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there's a strong drift of suspicion that
way among the men of B Company."</p>

<p>"The idiots!" muttered Prescott impatiently.</p>

<p>"One of my sergeants has just been telling
me about Overton's present standing in the
company. B Company men have always liked
Overton. In fact, he has been well liked all
through the battalion, but just now many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the men don't feel sure about the young fellow,"
continued Lieutenant Holmes. "Not a man will
admit that the case is proved, but a good many
of them don't like the looks of things. Especially
are the men disturbed by the fact of that revolver
being in Corporal Overton's bed, and
the fact of his being awake and appearing nervous
when the alarm was given."</p>

<p>"Greg, you don't believe Overton stole that
simpleton soldier's cash?" cried Prescott.</p>

<p>"I don't, and I won't," Lieutenant Holmes
replied. "Overton isn't that type of fellow.
He's a soldier all the way through, going and
coming, and the first characteristic of a real soldier
is honesty."</p>

<p>"Yet you say so many of the men suspect
him?" mused Prescott.</p>

<p>"Not exactly that they suspect him, but that
they'd like to have the whole matter cleared up
and see daylight through it."</p>

<p>"From what I know of soldiers," remarked
Lieutenant Prescott thoughtfully, "it looks like
a mean mess for Overton. Really, nothing but
long time, or complete vindication, will ever put
Overton back where he'd like to be in the esteem
of all his comrades."</p>

<p>"I know it," agreed Holmes. "That's why
I'm telling you all this about one of your own
men."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I ought to have known it myself," Prescott
reproached himself. "I ought not to have
waited to get the first strong news from an
officer of another company."</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose it was easier for me to get
this word than it would have been for you. B
Company men are too 'sore' to talk much about
it. But C Company men, as it doesn't affect
any of them, just treat the whole matter as one
of ordinary news."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dick Prescott rose and began to
pace the floor. He was deeply concerned&mdash;not
so much for Hal Overton's sake as for the general
good name of B Company. Moreover,
young Prescott knew that, if any man in his
company were unjustly suspected, it was his
duty, as one of the company officers, to find a
way to set the whole matter straight.</p>

<p>"What's all the beastly row about, any way?"
queried Lieutenant Algernon Ferrers.</p>

<p>Holmes explained it briefly.</p>

<p>"So it's all a row about some seven hundred
dollars, it is?" asked Algy.</p>

<p>"If you choose to put it that way," replied
Lieutenant Holmes.</p>

<p>"Then see here, Prescott, old chap," cried
Algy eagerly, "why all this rotten fuss? Why,
I see the way through it as clear as daylight!
I'll set the matter straight in thirty seconds!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>CORPORAL HAL'S ADMISSION</h3>


<div class='cap'>LIEUTENANT PRESCOTT paused, looking
sharply at Algy.</div>

<p>"Ferrers, if you can see a way
through difficulties as easily as you promise, then
you're going to be a valuable man for the Army.
What's your plan?"</p>

<p>"Why, as I understand it," beamed Ferrers
placidly, "the whole trouble is caused by the
loss of some seven hundred dollars that the Overton
chap got from the simpleton Green?"</p>

<p>"Seven hundred which some men almost suspect
that Corporal Overton took from Green,"
corrected Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"All the same thing, as far as the really important
details go," beamed Algy. "I'll settle
it out of hand. You know, dear chaps, the
guv'nor owns a few banks in his own name,
and he ships me yellow-backs by the case lots.
Result is, I always have plenty of money, and
am likely to have more than ever now, for there
doesn't seem to be much chance in the Army to
spend it. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what has all this to do with Corporal
Overton's unhappy situation?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"All leads up to the point, Prescott, dear
chap," protested Algy. "See how simple it all
really is? I can spare seven hundred dollars
as well as I can a cigarette. I'll hand the
amount to Overton. He'll hand it to Green&mdash;and
all the cause of the trouble is removed and
everybody happy."</p>

<p>"Just like that!" gasped Lieutenant Greg
Holmes ironically, and he appeared to need the
support of the mantel at which he clutched.</p>

<p>There was a savage look on Lieutenant Prescott's
face as he demanded:</p>

<p>"Ferrers, are you trying to make game of
me?"</p>

<p>"Make game of you?" echoed Lieutenant
Algy, with a face so blank, so full of wonderment
and so lacking in guile. "Why, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, going to the top drawer
of a dresser.</p>

<p>"Money talks," announced Algy, holding out
a long wallet. "There's a few thousand dollars
in this leather. Help yourself to whatever will
square Overton with the individual Green."</p>

<p>"Put your pocketbook up," replied Prescott
almost brusquely. "And accept my apology at
the same time, Ferrers, if you'll be so good. You
weren't trying to make fun of me; I know it
now. This is simply another buttered piece off
your thick cake of stupidity."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've never been noted for cleverness; even
the guv'nor admits that to me, in confidence,"
confessed Lieutenant Algy. "But why won't
the money do the trick?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;oh, why&mdash;tell him, won't you,
Holmesy? I'm off to see Captain Cortland."</p>

<p>Prescott strode away to his company commander
for advice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think, sir, I'm a good deal of
a fool to take such a keen interest in this matter
of Overton," suggested the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, an officer who isn't interested
in the men serving under him has done
wrongly in choosing the Army for his profession,"
replied Captain Cortland gravely. "I,
too, am disturbed, for, like yourself, Mr. Prescott,
I find it impossible to believe that such a
clean, clear-cut young soldier as Corporal Overton
has been guilty of dishonesty."</p>

<p>"Can you suggest anything that I can do,
sir?" the young lieutenant asked gravely.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking over that same matter.
It seems difficult to know what to do. Of
course you can let Corporal Overton see that
he has your confidence, Mr. Prescott. You may
assure him, at any time, that he also has mine,
if you think that will do him any good. But
the only thing that will actually clear up the
matter will be the discovery of the real thief&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that's a matter, I fancy, that's going to
be full of difficulty."</p>

<p>Leaving his captain's house, Lieutenant Prescott
took a walk along one side of the parade
ground. He hoped to encounter Hal, but that
young corporal was half a mile away at the
time, practising signaling under Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>Failing in encountering young Overton, Lieutenant
Prescott remembered that Corporal Noll
Terry, now in charge at the post telegraph station,
was likely to know all about his chum.</p>

<p>Stepping over to the station, where one operator
was sending a long military dispatch, while
another leaned idly back in his chair, Prescott
found Noll at another table, absorbed in the
study of an instrument that he had taken to
pieces.</p>

<p>"I want to say a few words to you, Corporal
Terry," announced the young lieutenant, stepping
into a box-like office at the rear of the
larger room.</p>

<p>Prescott threw himself down at the desk,
while Noll, after saluting, remained standing
at attention.</p>

<p>"Close the door, Corporal. That's it. Now,
I want to ask you a few questions about your
friend Corporal Overton, and the disappearance
of Private Green's money."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Noll flushed painfully, though all he answered
was:</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't misunderstand me, Corporal Terry,"
went on the young lieutenant. "I am not making
an official investigation, and I am not looking
for evidence to implicate Corporal Overton
in any crime. I don't mind telling you that I
haven't a particle of belief in Overton's guilt.
The very idea that he would rob any one is opposed
to the common sense of any one who
really knows your friend and his record."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>This time Noll's face was positively beaming
with pleasure.</p>

<p>"So, you see, you don't need to be in the least
on your guard in what you may say to me,"
continued the lieutenant, smiling in his most
friendly way. "I don't mind stating, further,
that my whole interest in this matter is the interest
of an officer who is determined, if possible,
to see a good man cleared from suspicion."</p>

<p>"What can I tell you, sir?" Noll asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, Corporal, the worst evidence pointing
to any presumption of guilt against your comrade
and friend is the finding of the revolver
hidden under his bedclothes. What do you
think of that incident?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think, sir, that the revolver must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
have been slipped in under the bedclothes by
some one who wanted to throw all the suspicion
on Corporal Overton."</p>

<p>"I agree with you. Now, was that man an
actual enemy of Corporal Overton's, or did he
merely thrust the revolver into the first bed that
he could in passing?"</p>

<p>"My own belief, sir, that an actual enemy
of Overton's did it, sir."</p>

<p>"Now, Corporal Terry, who are the men that
have cots past Corporal Overton's&mdash;that is, past
his when traveling away from Green's cot?"</p>

<p>"Hinkey, Clegg, Danes, Potter, Reed, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Freeland'">Vreeland</ins>
and myself, sir."</p>

<p>"With which one of the men you have named
has Corporal Overton had any trouble, either
recently or some time back?"</p>

<p>"With Hinkey, for one, sir."</p>

<p>"What was it over?"</p>

<p>Noll retold the incident of the friendly scuffle
between Corporals Overton and Hyman, and the
dropping of the signal flag, through a window
and upon Private Hinkey's head.</p>

<p>"Had Overton had trouble with other men?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more, sir, than that he had once
or twice rebuked Vreeland and Danes for carelessness
in squad drill."</p>

<p>"What kind of men are Vreeland and Danes,
in your opinion, Corporal?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Careless and happy-go-lucky, but good-hearted
fellows, sir, and likely to be good soldiers
when they've been licked into shape."</p>

<p>"But neither of them is inclined to be dishonest
or sulky?"</p>

<p>"From what I have seen of Vreeland and
Danes, sir, I am inclined to answer with a very
positive 'no.'"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott looked thoughtful, remaining
silent for some moments, while Corporal
Noll Terry stood looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Corporal," said the young officer finally,
"Mr. Holmes has told me what a very thorough
search was made after the alarm had been
given. But no sign of the missing money was
found. Have you any idea on that head? Can
you make even a plausible suggestion as to how
the money was taken care of by the thief?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you heard any of the men make reasonable
suggestions as to what was done with
the money?"</p>

<p>"I think I must have heard all the men in
the room talking about it at one time or another,
Lieutenant, but the men are puzzled. They cannot
account for the complete disappearance of
the money."</p>

<p>"Are you keeping your eyes and ears open
all the time, for any clue in the matter?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" Noll answered. "And I shan't
cease doing so until the whole mystery is cleaned
up."</p>

<p>"Good! May I depend upon you, Corporal,
to come to me, at any time, with any information
that you think will help?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and I thank you for the invitation
to do so."</p>

<p>"If I believed Corporal Overton the guilty
man, and could find evidence that would prove
his guilt and have him bounced out of the service,
then I'd do my whole duty," went on Lieutenant
Prescott. "But I simply can't believe
him guilty, and so I'm prepared to help him at
any time when there's the slightest chance."</p>

<p>"May I tell Corporal Overton that, sir?"
asked Noll eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but caution him not to mention to
others what I have said to you. You are also
at liberty to tell Overton that Captain Cortland
is wholly convinced of his innocence, and so, I
know, is Lieutenant Hampton. But some of
the men in the company, and more especially
in the squad room, are holding aloof from Corporal
Overton, are they not?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't exactly say that they are doing
it in a mean way, sir; but of course soldiers hate
thieves, and so the merest taint of a suspicion
serves to make some of the men feel rather shy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
about having anything unnecessary to do with
Corporal Overton."</p>

<p>"Too bad!" murmured Lieutenant Prescott.
Then, in his usual official tone:</p>

<p>"That is all, Corporal Terry."</p>

<p>Noll saluted and left the inner office. Almost
immediately afterward Lieutenant Prescott
sauntered out.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Hal, after some brisk practice
at wig-wagging, was on his way back to
barracks with Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>"You're going to make a real signalman, one
of these days, lad," remarked the sergeant,
kindly. "You have the speed, and you don't
lose any of the clearness of your signaling when
you go fast."</p>

<p>"It's great work," smiled Corporal Hal.
"Just for the moment it makes me almost sorry
that I didn't enlist in the signal corps."</p>

<p>"The infantry is the real branch of the service&mdash;the
real fighting arm," returned Sergeant
Hupner.</p>

<p>"Yes; I know it, and that's the principal reason
why I chose the infantry before enlisting."</p>

<p>Together the sergeant and his young corporal
entered the barracks, stepping into their own
squad room.</p>

<p>There the very first person they met was Private
William Green, looking, still, as though he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wanted to burst into tears. Green hadn't smiled
once since meeting with his big loss.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Sergeant," was Green's
greeting. He didn't seem to see Hal at all, a
fact that the boyish soldier noted instantly. It
cut like a whip to know that Green really suspected
his young corporal.</p>

<p>Hal stepped down the length of the squad
room. Some of the men greeted him, though
none very enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Then Noll came in, drawing his chum aside
and detailing the interview with Lieutenant
Prescott.</p>

<p>That brightened Hal Overton a good deal. In
the middle of the squad room some of the men
were having a jolly time, and laughing heartily.
Down at the further end of the room, near the
door, mournful William Green kept by himself
and grieved.</p>

<p>"It's certainly fine to know that one's officers
trust him, anyway," Hal declared.</p>

<p>"Oh, this abominable business will all be
cleared up before long," Noll Terry predicted
cheerily.</p>

<p>"I'd like to believe you," Corporal Hal
smiled wistfully.</p>

<p>"Wait and see!"</p>

<p>The merriment in the middle of the room was
now going on at its height. Private Clegg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
who was an excellent storyteller, was relating
one of his very very best, and it bore on Army
life.</p>

<p>Hal and Noll took chairs at one of the writing
tables.</p>

<p>A few minutes later a wild whoop sounded
from Private William Green.</p>

<p>"I've got it! I've got it!" he yelled, dancing
about like a crazy Indian.</p>

<p>"A bat in your belfry? Sure you've got it,"
yelled Private Clegg.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner had run over to where Green
was dancing.</p>

<p>"I've got the money. It has come back to
me," sang William Green joyously.</p>

<p>In an instant there was a curiosity-inspired
rush that every man in the room shared.</p>

<p>Private Green now held high aloft over his
head a long envelope whose bulkiness everyone
else could see.</p>

<p>"It's the money!" he gasped, chokingly.</p>

<p>"Every man in the room but Green fall in!"
roared Sergeant Hupner's voice. "Corporal
Terry, take charge of the formation!"</p>

<p>There was a queer, strained hush in the room
for the next few moments. Hardly anything
was heard but the low breathing of the men,
or the few crisp, quiet words of Corporal Noll
as he made the men dress their alignment on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Corporal Hal, who stood at the right of the
line.</p>

<p>"Hold your men so," nodded Sergeant Hupner
tersely. "Now, Green, are you sure you
have all your money back?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope so," faltered Green. "The envelope
is bulky enough."</p>

<p>"Put it on your cot and let me see it," ordered
Hupner.</p>

<p>Green had already broken the flap of the envelope,
revealing the edges of a considerable
thickness of banknotes.</p>

<p>"Why, there's a note here with the bills,"
proclaimed the excited soldier.</p>

<p>"What does the note say?"</p>

<p>"It says 'Friend, you'll find all your money
here except twenty dollars that I spent. Meant
to keep it all, but found stolen money brings
no pleasure. Hope you'll forgive me.'"</p>

<p>"What does the writing look like?" demanded
Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>"It ain't written; it's printed," replied Private
Green. "Here, take the note and look at
it."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner did glance at the note
briefly, but here he felt he would find no clue.
After all, a man's printing does not closely resemble
his writing.</p>

<p>"Anything written on the envelope?" demanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the sergeant, holding out his hand.
Yes; the envelope contained the inscription,
"Pvt. Wm. Green." That was all; but it wasn't
printed. The words were written in bold,
flowing handwriting. Sergeant Hupner felt a
throb as he glanced at the handwriting on that
envelope. But he knew his duty.</p>

<p>"Corporal Terry, go to the nearest window
and have the sentry pass the word for the corporal
of the guard!"</p>

<p>Then Hupner asked one more question:</p>

<p>"Green, where and how did you find this
envelope?"</p>

<p>"Just the moment before I helloed. It was
tucked inside my bedding, so that just the end
of the envelope showed."</p>

<p>Quickly the corporal of the guard was on
hand, accompanied by two privates of the guard.
Sergeant Hupner explained what had happened,
adding:</p>

<p>"Corporal, I think you'd better send for the
officer of the day."</p>

<p>That officer of the day, who shortly arrived,
was Lieutenant Ray of C company.</p>

<p>He listened gravely, while Sergeant Hupner
told the story, then asked a few questions of
Private Green.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," directed Lieutenant Ray, "start
the envelope passing down the line. Each man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is to look at the handwriting, and state whether
he recognizes it."</p>

<p>All this time the men had remained standing
in line, though at ease.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hupner, with a queer look, passed
the envelope to Corporal Hal Overton, who stood
at the right of the line.</p>

<p>The instant he glanced at the writing Hal
started, then changed color.</p>

<p>"Do you know the writing on that envelope,
Corporal Overton?" demanded the officer of the
day, eyeing the young soldier.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Are you positive that you know whose writing
it is, Corporal Overton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>"Mine, sir," replied Corporal Hal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE SQUAD ROOM TURNS COLD</h3>


<div class='cap'>ON the listening men the effect of this admission
was that of a bombshell.</div>

<p>Yet, because they were soldiers, they
took their bombshell quietly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ray was astounded, yet his voice
did not quiver as he asked, briskly:</p>

<p>"Then, Corporal Overton, you admit having
addressed the envelope?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't trifle with me, Corporal!"</p>

<p>"I am not, sir."</p>

<p>"Yet you admit having addressed it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I believe this to be my writing beyond
a doubt. Yet, sir, I have no recollection
of having written this address. All I know is
that it is my handwriting."</p>

<p>"Sergeant, dismiss your men," directed
Lieutenant Ray, as he reached out and took the
envelope. "Corporal Overton, you will not
leave the room."</p>

<p>"Is the corporal under arrest, sir?" asked
Sergeant Hupner, in a quiet voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Sergeant. But I wish to have him immediately
at hand, in case the company, battalion
or regimental commanders wish to see
him. When the men fall in for supper formation,
if Corporal Overton has not been summoned
by an officer, then let him march to mess
with the rest, but he must return here immediately
after the meal."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ray withdrew, followed by the
corporal and privates of the guard.</p>

<p>"I am not forbidden to speak to other men,
am I, Sergeant?" asked Hal Overton, going directly
up to him.</p>

<p>"You are not in any sense in arrest, Corporal,"
replied Hupner, then adding, in a lower
voice:</p>

<p>"And I hope you'll do some mighty hard
thinking, lad, and be able to give a very straight
account about that envelope."</p>

<p>"Sergeant, as I am in no way guilty of any
part in the robbery, I do not believe that there
will be much trouble about being able to make
an explanation when I have had time to think."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right, Overton, for I haven't
an idea in the world that you are, or could be,
a thief."</p>

<p>"Thank you, from the bottom of my heart,
Sergeant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Private William Green sat on a stool near
the head of his cot, counting his recovered
money for the third time.</p>

<p>"Is it all there, Green?" asked Corporal Hal,
going over to the soldier.</p>

<p>"All but the twenty dollars that it is supposed
to be shy," replied Green rather gruffly
and without looking up.</p>

<p>"Green, I hope you haven't an idea that I'm
the crook," Hal went on.</p>

<p>"Of course not. But there's a stack of appearances
against you, just the same," replied
William Green dryly.</p>

<p>"See here!" Hal spoke sharply, the pain ringing
in his voice. "Do you really believe that I
stole your money in the first place?"</p>

<p>"I've got most of it back, and I'd rather not
express any opinions, Corporal," was Green's
evasive reply.</p>

<p>Just at this instant Corporal Noll Terry joined
the pair.</p>

<p>"William," chuckled Noll, "the men have
got up a new name for you. Instead of calling
you William Green they're going to nickname
you 'Long Green' after this."</p>

<p>"Let 'em," grunted Private Green briefly,
and without a sign of understanding the slangy
joke.</p>

<p>Hal turned away, a choking feeling in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
throat, though his outward demeanor was brave
enough.</p>

<p>"Clegg, and the rest of you," began Overton,
stopping by a group of the soldiers, "will you
all do your best to try to remember some time
when I may have had occasion to address an
envelope to Green?"</p>

<p>Clegg stopped talking with his comrades,
half-wheeled about, looked the young corporal
steadily in the eyes, then turned back once
more to carry on his talk with the other soldiers.</p>

<p>Hal Overton's face went deathly pale.</p>

<p>This was the direct cut, the snub, from his
mates of the squad room.</p>

<p>After that Hal would make no advances to
any man in the room who did not first signify
that he believed in the hapless corporal.</p>

<p>"Don't mind 'em, Hal," muttered Noll soothingly,
coming up behind his bunkie at the far
end of the squad room. "They're only human,
and you will have to admit that, just for the
moment, all things being taken into consideration,
that appearances do hit you a bit. But
the whole thing will all be straightened out before
long."</p>

<p>"Will it?" asked Hal almost listlessly. He
had to speak thus, to prevent the sob in his
throat from getting into his voice. For, soldier
though he was, and a rarely good one, he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
still only a boy in years, and this air of suspicion
in the squad room made all life look wholly
dark to him.</p>

<p>"Surely all will come right," insisted Noll.
"You've plenty of good friends around here."</p>

<p>"You and Sergeant Hupner," smiled Corporal
Overton bitterly. "But at least, old
chap, you two make up in quality what you
lack in numbers."</p>

<p>The call for mess formation rang at last.
Corporal Hal went to his place in the company
line as briskly as ever.</p>

<p>Just as the men were passing Corporal Hyman
hit Hal a clip on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Buck up, old spinal trouble!" urged Hyman
heartily, in a low voice. "Don't disappoint
every friend and true believer you've got."</p>

<p>There were a few others who were openly
friendly in the company mess, but Hal could
force only a few mouthfuls of food and a cup
of tea down his throat that night.</p>

<p>At a little after eight o'clock an orderly of
the guard came striding into the squad room
to inform Overton that Colonel North would see
him at the officers' club.</p>

<p>Thither Hal went. When he reported he was
directed to a little smoking room that stood just
off the dining room. When Hal knocked and
entered at command he found Colonel North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
there, flanked by Major Silsbee and B company's
officers.</p>

<p>Colonel North had the accusing envelope and
the note in the printed scrawl in his hand.</p>

<p>"Come in, Corporal," called the regimental
commander. "I sent for you to inquire whether
you have yet thought of any way of accounting
for this envelope being in your handwriting."</p>

<p>"I have not, sir," Hal answered.</p>

<p>"Take the envelope and look at it."</p>

<p>Hal Overton obeyed.</p>

<p>"Do you think it likely, Corporal, that the
writing on that envelope is a forged imitation
of your own handwriting?"</p>

<p>"It is possible, sir, of course," Hal made
frank, direct reply. "Yet, sir, I am inclined
to believe that the writing is really mine."</p>

<p>"Hand me back the envelope. Now, go to
the table over there, where you will find an envelope.
Take up the pen and direct another
envelope in just the words that this is addressed."</p>

<p>"I've done so, sir," replied Hal, a moment
later.</p>

<p>"Now in the lower corner of the envelope
write the words, 'My own writing, Overton.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I've done it."</p>

<p>"Bring the envelope to me, Corporal Overton."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel North now compared the writing on
the two envelopes, then passed them to the other
officers present, who carefully examined these
exhibits.</p>

<p>"The writings look identical, sir," was Captain
Cortland's comment.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Major Silsbee. The other
younger officers nodded.</p>

<p>"Corporal," went on Colonel North&mdash;and now
there was a world of real sympathy in his voice
as he looked at this fine young soldier&mdash;"this
is a very painful happening. Some slight,
surface indications are against you, but to me it
looks as though some one else had hatched up
the circumstances so that they would seem
bound to smite you. Of course, to everyone but
yourself, there is a possibility that you may be
guilty. It may please you, however, to know,
Corporal, that you still possess the confidence
of all your officers."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, I thank all my officers."</p>

<p>"In this country, Corporal," continued
Colonel North, "every man is presumed innocent
until he has been proven guilty. In your
own case you are not only not proven guilty, but
you are not even accused. Nor, on any such
evidence as we yet have before us could any accusation
be made with any hope of being able
to prove you guilty. I do not for a moment believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
you guilty. You have too fine a record as
a soldier for any such belief to find acceptance
without the strongest, most positive proof."</p>

<p>"There is something that Captain Cortland
and I have had in mind to do for you. The
present time, therefore, seems an especially suitable
one for showing the full measure of our
confidence in you, Corporal. Of course, if any
evidence came up that would sustain a charge
of crime against you, then what we are thinking
of doing could be very easily undone at need.
Corporal Overton, at parade, to-morrow afternoon,
your appointment as sergeant in B company
will be announced."</p>

<p>Hal started, colored, then turned pale.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thank you, sir," he stammered. "But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, my man?" inquired the colonel kindly.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but wouldn't the appointment
be better made at some later date?"</p>

<p>"Why?" shot out Colonel North.</p>

<p>"I fear I may not have as much force with
a squad room as a sergeant should have, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you will have to develop that force,"
replied Colonel North dryly. "It's in you, I
know."</p>

<p>Poor Hal! At any other time this much-wanted
promotion would have been hailed joyfully.
Now it seemed almost like wormwood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>BACKING THE NEW SERGEANT</h3>


<div class='cap'>"CORPORAL OVERTON, B company, is
hereby appointed a sergeant in the
same company, the appointment to
take effect immediately. Sergeant Overton's
company commander will assign him to the
charge of a squad room in B company."</div>

<p>That was published with the orders the very
next afternoon, at parade.</p>

<p>It came with startling suddenness to most of
the men in B company. Noll was the only one
who had been warned in advance, and he had
held his peace.</p>

<p>Only one other man in the battalion had
known it, and that was Grimes, the grimly silent
private who sold goods in the quartermaster's
store. Of Grimes, Hal had already purchased
the necessary sergeant chevrons that he
might have them ready.</p>

<p>"On dismissal of the company Sergeant Overton
will at once report to me," announced Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>Hal, therefore, on falling out of ranks, went
directly to his company commander, saluting.</p>

<p>"You are to have charge of the squad room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
next to Sergeant Hupner's," began the captain,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"And now, my lad, don't feel at all down
cast over some circumstances that have come
up in barracks," continued the captain, resting
a friendly hand on the new young sergeant's
shoulder. "Take firm charge of your squad
room from the outset. Force your men to respect
as well as obey you. You will have all
the necessary countenance of your officers. Do
your duty as a soldier, as you have always done,
and do not allow yourself to entertain fears of
any kind."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I shall do as you direct."</p>

<p>"I know it, Sergeant Overton. I have confidence
in you. Now, I am going to step down
to your new squad room with you."</p>

<p>If Hal Overton quaked just a bit as he rested
his right hand on the door of the room in which
he was henceforth to rule, nothing in his bearing
betrayed the fact.</p>

<p>He threw open the door for Captain Cortland
to pass in ahead of him, at the same time calling
clearly:</p>

<p>"Squad room, attention!"</p>

<p>Captain Cortland strode in among his men,
who, halting where they were, faced toward him
and stood at attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men," called Captain Cortland, "this is
your new sergeant. He will be obeyed and respected
accordingly."</p>

<p>Then Captain Cortland turned and left the
room.</p>

<p>Corporal Hyman, who belonged in this room,
came forward at once, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the lucky one, Sergeant!" cried
Hyman. "But I'm glad you got the step up.
You've won it. Well, we're all here. Fall to
and reorganize us, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"There will have to be very little of that, I
imagine, Corporal Hyman," replied the boyish
young sergeant, smiling. "The room has been
running all right, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"So-so," laughed Corporal Hyman. "But I
believe that some of these buck doughboys need
a bit of jacking up."</p>

<p>Corporal Hyman turned, with a grinning face,
toward the men. But none of them were looking
that way at the moment. Every other man
in the room appeared interested in some other
subject than the new sergeant.</p>

<p>"Go for 'em," muttered Hyman grimly under
his breath. "It's a shame for you to have to
stand for this sort of thing, kid! Pound 'em
into shape. Make 'em stand around for you."</p>

<p>"I will, in matters of discipline and routine,
whenever necessary," Sergeant Hal answered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in an equally low voice. "But if the men don't
care for me personally that's another matter.
I'll never persecute any soldier just because he
doesn't like me."</p>

<p>"It's all that cursed misunderstanding over
'Long Green,'" muttered Corporal Hyman.
"Of course you can't very well make a yell
about it, but I see several fights on my hands
from right now on, until I've gotten these buck
doughboys licked into a proper appreciation of
the new boss of their squad room."</p>

<p>"Don't have any fights on my account, Hyman,"
urged Sergeant Hal.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't, then," came the dry retort.
"I'll have a few good fights on my own account,
then, for it's a personal grievance when the men
turn down a man that I like."</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted, at that moment,
by the in-coming of First Sergeant Gray.</p>

<p>"I'm glad over your rise, Overton," beamed
the first sergeant. "And it has come quickly.
I'm here to warn you for guard duty. You'll
report at guard mount to-morrow morning as
sergeant of the guard."</p>

<p>"That does come rather speedily, doesn't it?"
laughed Hal. "Who is to be officer of the day
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Ferrers," responded Sergeant
Gray gravely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"What? The joke to be officer of the day?"
exploded Corporal Hyman.</p>

<p>"Corporal," came the first sergeant's swift,
serious rebuke, "whenever you allude to your
superior officers you'll do so with the utmost
respect."</p>

<p>"My flag's down," replied Corporal Hyman.
"I surrender. But, Sergeant, is there anything
in the blue book of rules against my going away
in a corner for a quiet laugh."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Sergeant Gray stiffly, and Hyman
left them.</p>

<p>"Of course you understand, Sergeant Overton,"
went on Sergeant Gray, "that a little
more than the usual responsibility will devolve
upon you to-morrow. You know how new Lieutenant
Ferrers is to the Army. You may be
able quietly to prevent him from doing something
foolish&mdash;some little hint that you can give
him you know."</p>

<p>"I'll have my eyes open," Sergeant Hal promised.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gray warned two other men in the
room to report for guard duty in the morning,
then went to Sergeant Hupner's room to warn
others. Hal turned out the squad at mess call.
By this time the new young sergeant had sewed
on his new chevron, the outward sign of his promotion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Through most of the evening Hal and Hyman
sat apart by one of the writing tables, chatting
by themselves. Since the men had shown open
dislike of the new sergeant Hal did not force
himself upon them. Finally, however, the fun
started by some of the men becoming altogether
too rough and noisy.</p>

<p>"Squad room attention!" shouted Sergeant
Hal, leaping to his feet. Corporal Hyman, too,
jumped up.</p>

<p>All of the men came instantly to attention.
Some of them looked merely curious, but a few
glared back at their new sergeant.</p>

<p>"Some of you men have been more noisy and
rough than is warranted by a proper sense of
freedom in barracks," Hal said quietly but
firmly. "Fun may go on, but all real disorder
will cease at once, and not be resumed. That
is all."</p>

<p>Hal turned to resume his seat at the table.
But from three or four men in the center of the
room, as they turned away, came a muffled
groan.</p>

<p>That sign of insubordination brought the
young sergeant to his feet once more in an instant.
His under lip trembled slightly, but he
strode in among the men.</p>

<p>"Men, I've something to say to you," announced
the new sergeant coolly. "I intend to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
preserve discipline in this squad room, though
I don't expect to do it like a martinet. Some of
you groaned, just now, when my back was
turned. Soldiers of the regular Army are men
of courage. No real man fights behind another
man's back. Has any man here anything that
he wishes to say to my face?"</p>

<p>It was a tense moment. Three or four of the
men looked as though tempted to "say a lot."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hal, his hands tightly gripped,
stood facing them, waiting.</p>

<p>Nearly a score of feet away Corporal Hyman
stood negligently by. There was nothing aggressive
in his manner, but he was ready to go
to the support of his sergeant.</p>

<p>"Has any man here anything that he wishes
to say to me?" Hal repeated.</p>

<p>Still silence was preserved.</p>

<p>"Then let us have no more child's play by
those who are old enough to be men twenty-four
hours in a day," warned Overton crisply.</p>

<p>He hadn't said much, but his look, his tone
and manner told the men that he was in command
in that room, and that he intended to keep
the command fully in his own hands.</p>

<p>There was no further trouble that night,
though the young sergeant could not escape the
knowledge that he was generally disliked here.</p>

<p>When guard-mounting assembly sounded at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
nine the next morning Sergeant Hal Overton
marched the new guard on to the field.</p>

<p>Battalion Adjutant Wright was on hand, but
Lieutenant Algy Ferrers, the new officer of the
day, was absent.</p>

<p>The adjutant turned, scanning the ground between
there and officers' row. There was no
sign of Lieutenant Ferrers, and in the Army
lack of punctuality, even to the fraction of a
minute, is a grave offense.</p>

<p>"Orderly," directed Adjutant Wright, turning
to a man, "go to Lieutenant Ferrers' quarters
and direct him, with my compliments, to
come here as quickly as he possibly can."</p>

<p>The orderly departed on a run. But he soon
came back, alone.</p>

<p>"Sir, Lieutenant Ferrers is not in his quarters?"</p>

<p>"Not in quarters? Did you look in at the
officers' club, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Lieutenant Ferrers' bed was not
slept in last night, so his striker told me."</p>

<p>Adjutant Wright fumed inwardly, though he
turned to Hal to say:</p>

<p>"Sergeant, inspect the guard."</p>

<p>A little later Hal marched his new guard
down to the guard house. Lieutenant Ferrers
had not yet been found, and there was a storm
brewing.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>ASTONISHMENT JOLTS MR. FERRERS</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT was nearly four in the afternoon when the
sentry on post number one called briskly:</div>

<p>"Sergeant of the guard, post number
one!"</p>

<p>"What is it, sentry?" asked Hal, stepping
briskly out of the guard house.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Ferrers is approaching, Sergeant,"
replied the sentry, nodding his head
down the road.</p>

<p>An auto car bowled leisurely up the road
toward the main entrance to the post. In it,
at the wheel, sat Lieutenant Algy Ferrers, who
was supposed to be officer of the day. He was
driving the one car that he had been allowed
to store on post.</p>

<p>Algy looked decidedly tired and bored as he
drove along.</p>

<p>"Halt the lieutenant, sentry."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Just as the lieutenant turned his car in at
the gate, the sentry, instead of coming to present
arms, threw his gun over to port arms, calling:</p>

<p>"Halt, sir. Sergeant of the guard, post number
one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Algy, with a look of astonishment on his face,
slowed the car down and stopped. Sergeant
Hal approached, giving him the rifle salute.</p>

<p>"Well, what's in the wind, Sergeant?" demanded
Algy, reaching in a pocket for his cigarette
case.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for stopping you, sir, but
the adjutant directed me to ask you to report
to him immediately upon your return, sir."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll drop around and see Wright
as soon as I put my car up and get a bath,"
replied Lieutenant Algy, striking a match.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, sir; don't light that cigarette
until you've driven on."</p>

<p>"Now how long since sergeants have taken
to giving officers orders?" inquired Mr. Ferrers
in very great astonishment.</p>

<p>"The guard always has power to enforce the
rules, sir. And smoking is forbidden when addressing
the guard on official business."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay you're right, Sergeant," assented
Algy, dropping his match out of the car.
"Very good; I'll see Wright within an hour
or so."</p>

<p>"But the order was explicit, sir, that you are
to report to the adjutant at once. If you'll pardon
the suggestion, Lieutenant, I think it will
be better, sir, if you drive straight to the adjutant's
office."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, all right," nodded Algy indifferently.
"'Pon my word, it takes a fellow quite a while to
get hold of some of these peculiar Army customs.
Even an officer is likely to be ordered
about a good deal as though he were a dog. Eh,
Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"I have never felt like a dog, sir, since entering
the Army."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say Wright is quite proper in his
order, you know. I'll go up and drop in on
him right now."</p>

<p>Both sergeant and sentry saluted again as
this very unusual officer turned on the speed and
went driving lazily up to headquarters' building.</p>

<p>Algy Ferrers had his cigarette going by the
time that he stepped leisurely into the adjutant's
office.</p>

<p>"Some one told me you wanted to see me,
Wright," began Algy.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wright wheeled around briskly
upon his subordinate.</p>

<p>"I want to see you, Mr. Ferrers, only to pass
you on to the colonel. I'll tell him that you're
here."</p>

<p>Adjutant Wright stepped into the inner office,
nodding his head at the colonel, then wheeled
about.</p>

<p>"Colonel North will see you, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Algy took three quick whiffs of his cigarette,
then tossed it away. He had already gained an
idea that a young officer does not go into his
colonel's presence smoking.</p>

<p>"So you're here, sir?" demanded Colonel
North, looking up from his desk as Algy came
to a halt before him.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm here, Colonel&mdash;or most of me is.
My, how seedy I feel this afternoon! Do you
know, Colonel, I'm almost persuaded to cut out
social&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, Mr. Ferrers!" commanded Colonel
North very coldly. "Concern yourself only with
answering my questions. Yesterday afternoon
you were warned that you would be officer of
the day to-day."</p>

<p>"Bless me, so I was," assented Algy mildly.</p>

<p>"Yet this morning you failed to be present
at guard-mount."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'll tell you how it happened."</p>

<p>"Be good enough to tell me without delay."</p>

<p>"Colonel, did you ever hear of the Douglas-Fraziers,
of Detroit?"</p>

<p>"Answer my question, Mr. Ferrers!"</p>

<p>"Or the Porterby-Masons, of Chicago?" pursued
Algy calmly. "Both families are very old
friends of our family. They and some others
were very much interested in my being a soldier,
and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"You being a soldier!" exploded the irate
colonel under his breath.</p>

<p>"And so they and some others who were on
their way to the coast on a special train had
their train switched off at Clowdry last night.
They expected to get in at eight, but it was
eleven when they arrived last night. However,
sir, they telephoned right up to me and tipped
me off to join them at once at the Clowdry Hotel.
So what could I do?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" quivered Colonel North, who seemed
momentarily all but bereft of speech.</p>

<p>"What could I do, sir? Of course I couldn't
turn down such old friends. Besides, there were
some fine girls with the party. And it was too
late, Colonel, to go waking you over the telephone,
so I just went down to the quartermaster's
stable and got my car out and was mighty
soon in Clowdry."</p>

<p>"There might have been nothing very serious
in that, Mr. Ferrers, had you returned in time
for guard-mount this morning."</p>

<p>"But I simply couldn't. Don't you understand?"
pleaded Algy with good-natured patience.</p>

<p>"No, sir! I don't understand!" thundered
Colonel North. "All I understand, sir, is that
you have disgraced yourself and your regiment
by failing to report as the officer of the day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me explain, sir," went on Algy, with a
slight wave of his hand. "When I got to the
hotel the Douglas-Fraziers had ordered dinner.
They were starved. I had a pretty good appetite
myself. Dinner lasted until half past one.
Then we had a jolly time, some of the girls singing
in the hotel parlor. After they'd turned in,
between three and four in the morning, the men
insisted on hearing how well I was coming along
in the Army."</p>

<p>"They did?" inquired the colonel, with an
irony that was wholly thrown away on Algy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And then we sat down to play
cards. First thing we knew it was ten in the
morning. Then we had breakfast, and the ladies
got downstairs before the meal was over. The
Douglas-Frazier train couldn't pull out until
three thirty this afternoon. So, after they'd
gone to so much trouble to see me, and had put
up such a ripping time for me, of course I had
to stay in town to see them off."</p>

<p>"Naturally," assented Colonel North with fine
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"I am glad you understand it, Colonel, and
so there's not a bit of harm done, after all. I'm
an ignoramus about guard duty, anyway, and
I'll wager the guard got on better without me,
after all. And now, Colonel, since I've given you
a wholly satisfactory explanation as to why I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
simply couldn't be here to-day, if you've nothing
more to say to me, sir, I'll go to my quarters,
get into my bath and then tumble into bed,
for I'm just about dead for slee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel North rose fiercely, looking as though
he were threatened with an attack of apoplexy.</p>

<p>"Stop all your idiotic chatter, Mr. Ferrers,
and listen to me with whatever little power of
concentration you may possess. Your conduct,
sir, has been wholly unfitting an officer and a
gentleman. If I did my full duty I'd order you
in arrest at once, and have you brought to trial
before a general court-martial. You have visited
upon yourself a disgrace that you can't wipe
out in a year. You have&mdash;but what's the use?
You wouldn't understand!"</p>

<p>"I'm a little dull just now, sir," agreed Algy.
"But after a bath and a long night's sleep I'll
be as fresh as ever."</p>

<p>"You'll have neither bath nor sleep!" retorted
the colonel testily. "You'll go to your quarters
and get into your uniform without a moment's
delay. You'll be back here in fifteen minutes,
or I'll order you in arrest. And you'll
finish out your tour of guard duty. You'll be on
duty and awake, sir, until the old guard goes off
to-morrow morning. More, you'll remain all that
time at the guard house, so that the sergeant of
the guard can be sure that you are awake."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good heavens!" murmured Algy.</p>

<p>"Further, Mr. Ferrers, until further orders,
you will not step off the limits of the post without
express permission from either myself or
Major Silsbee. Now, go to your quarters, sir&mdash;and
don't dare to be gone more than fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott, hearing some one move
in Mr. Ferrers' rooms, looked in inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm in an awful hurry. I've got
to get back to that beastly colonel," explained
Algy.</p>

<p>"Beastly? Colonel North is a fine old brick!"
retorted Prescott indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well, he has an&mdash;er&mdash;most peculiar temper
at times," insisted Algy. "Why, he seemed
positively annoyed because I had obeyed the
social instinct and had gone away to meet old
friends of our family."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what you did to-day?"
demanded Lieutenant Prescott. "Ferrers,
you've been guilty of conduct that is sufficient
to get an officer kicked out of the service for
good and all."</p>

<p>"And just between ourselves," sputtered Algy,
"I don't believe the officer would lose much
by the operation. Have you any idea of the
social importance of the Douglas-Fraziers and
of the&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, hang the Douglas-Fraziers and all their
works," uttered Prescott disgustedly. "Algy,
are you ever going to become a soldier?"</p>

<p>"You're as bad as the colonel!" muttered
Ferrers. "What the Army needs is a little
more exact understanding of social life and its
obligations."</p>

<p>"Let me help you on with your sword," interrupted
Prescott dryly. "You're getting it
tangled up between your legs."</p>

<p>"I'm excited, that's why," returned Ferrers.
"It all comes of having a colonel who understands
nothing of the social life. There; now
I'm ready, and I must get away on the bounce."</p>

<p>"I'll walk along with you and explain the
nature of your offense of to-day, if you don't
mind," proposed Prescott.</p>

<p>Algy Ferrers reported at Colonel North's
office and soon came out.</p>

<p>"Now I'm off," cried Ferrers gayly, as he
came out again.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you've ever been anything
else but 'off,'" murmured Prescott, as he stood
in front of headquarters and watched Algy, who
was actually walking briskly.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Prescott stood there Colonel
North came out. The younger officer wheeled,
saluting respectfully.</p>

<p>"Mr. Prescott, if you've nothing important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
on this evening, will you drop down to the guard
house for a little while? You may be able to
prevent Mr. Ferrers from doing something that
will compel me to resort to almost as strong
measures as I would adopt with a really responsible
being."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'll pay Mr. Ferrers a visit soon
after dinner."</p>

<p>"Of course, the young man has to break in
at guard duty some time," continued the regiment's
commander. "But I am very glad to
know that young Overton is sergeant of the
guard to-night. He will prevent anyone from
stealing the guard house!"</p>

<p>"I rather think Sergeant Overton would, sir.
He's pretty young, but he's an all-around soldier."</p>

<p>"I wish," muttered the colonel, as he turned
to stride toward his own quarters, "that Overton
were the lieutenant and Mr. Ferrers the
sergeant. Then I could reduce <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ferrer'">Ferrers</ins> and
get the surgeon to order him into hospital!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>PRIVATE HINKEY DELIVERS HIS ANSWER</h3>


<div class='cap'>THANKS to a most capable sergeant of
the guard, Lieutenant Algy got through
his balance of the tour of guard duty
without setting the post on fire.</div>

<p>There was no rest, however, for the irresponsible
young lieutenant.</p>

<p>For three successive mornings Ferrers had
to grub hard at drill, with Lieutenant Prescott
standing by to coach him.</p>

<p>Then, on the fourth morning, Lieutenant Algy
was ordered out to take A Company on a twenty-mile
hike over rough country.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Reed knows the whole route and
will be a most capable guide, Mr. Ferrers," explained
Captain Ruggles. "We shall look for
you to be back by five o'clock this afternoon.
Don't use your men too hard. Now, I'll stand
by to see you start the company."</p>

<p>With a brave determination to show how
worthy he was of trust, Lieutenant Algy stepped
briskly over to A Company, which rested in
ranks in platoon front. Drawing his sword, he
commanded:</p>

<p>"Attention!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon he put the company through half
a dozen movements of the manual of arms, next
marching the company away in column of fours.
The regulars, of course, responded like clockwork.
They made a fine appearance as they
started off under their freakish second lieutenant.
Ere they had gone far Ferrers swung them
into column of twos at the route step.</p>

<p>"He's doing that almost well," muttered Captain
Ruggles under his breath. "I believe the
young cub is trying to be a soldier, after all."</p>

<p>It still lacked much of two in the afternoon
when Captain Ruggles, leaving his quarters, saw
his company marching back.</p>

<p>"Gracious! How did the youngster ever get
the men over the ground in this time?" wondered
Captain Ruggles, glancing at his watch.
"And he hasn't used the company up, either.
The men move as actively as though they had
just come from bed and a bath."</p>

<p>Captain Ruggles walked rapidly over toward
barracks. Lieutenant Ferrers threw his company
into column of platoons, faced them about
and brought the men to a halt. Then he wheeled
about, saluting Captain Ruggles.</p>

<p>"Any further orders, sir?" inquired Algy.</p>

<p>"No, Lieutenant. Dismiss the company."</p>

<p>As soon as the men had started barrackwards,
Captain Ruggles asked the lieutenant:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you manage it, Ferrers, to bring
the men back in such fine condition and so early
in the day?"</p>

<p>"Just a matter of good judgment, Captain,"
beamed Algy.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I changed the orders a bit, sir, to meet the
conditions that I discovered."</p>

<p>"Conditions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain. The day proved to be extremely
warm. I marched the men for about
six miles; it may have been nearer seven.
Curiously enough, Sergeant Reed and I disagreed
on that point. He said we had gone
about a mile and a half."</p>

<p>"Well? What next?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I found it so warm that I couldn't
march with any comfort at all. Now, I don't
believe an officer should expect his men to go
where he isn't willing to go himself, and as for
myself I didn't want to go any further. So I
halted the company and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Captain," smiled Lieutenant Ferrers,
"I just let the men enjoy themselves under the
trees until it was time to have their dinner on
the field rations they'd taken along."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, sir, I marched them back here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I'll take them out again some day when the
weather is cooler, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Ruggles acted a good deal like a
man who is about to lose his temper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferrers," came his rasping order, "go
to your rooms! Remain there until you hear
from Colonel North, Major Silsbee or myself."</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth have I done now?"
gasped the astonished young man.</p>

<p>"Go to your rooms, sir!"</p>

<p>"Now, what ails good old Ruggles? Isn't the
Army the queerest old place on the map of the
moon?"</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes Algy Ferrers, sitting
back in an easy chair in his quarters, glancing
out of a window with a look of absolute boredom,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'receive'">received</ins> a telephone call.</p>

<p>"Colonel North's compliments, and will you
come to his house at once?" was the brief message.</p>

<p>"Now, I shouldn't wonder if old Ruggles had
forgotten to mind his own business," muttered
Algy disconsolately, as he reached for his fatigue
cap.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferrers," was the colonel's stern greeting,
"every day your conduct becomes more incomprehensible!"</p>

<p>"And every day, sir, I might say," retorted
the young man pleasantly, "the Army becomes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
harder to understand. I don't wish to be guilty
of any impertinence, sir, but wouldn't it be well
to have a law enacted that officers from civil
life should be appointed wholly from clerks,
who have learned how to keep office hours and
never do any thinking for themselves?"</p>

<p>"There might be some advantage in that plan,
Mr. Ferrers," replied the colonel grimly. "And
I can't help feeling that you would give infinitely
more satisfaction here if you had first been
trained a bit in one of your father's many offices.
I don't suppose you have the least idea, sir, of
what a grave offense you have committed to-day?"</p>

<p>"I expected to be praised, sir," replied Algy
almost testily, "for having been highly humane
to the men under my command."</p>

<p>"Humane!" exploded Colonel North. "Bah!
Mr. Ferrers, do you imagine that our regulars
are so many weaklings, that they have to come
in when it rains, or stay in when the sun shines?
Bah! You have been guilty of gross disobedience
of orders, and you are an officer, sir&mdash;supposed
to be engaged in teaching obedience to
enlisted men. That is all, sir&mdash;you may go to
your quarters!"</p>

<p>By the time that young Mr. Ferrers reached
his own quarters he found Lieutenant Prescott
there, though the latter did not say a word about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Colonel North having ordered him to make the
call.</p>

<p>Algy immediately started in upon what was,
for him, a furious tirade.</p>

<p>"Do you know, dear chap," he wound up,
"I can't always understand a man like old Papa
North. Sometimes I think he's just a beast!"</p>

<p>But Prescott's laughing advice was:</p>

<p>"Hold yourself in, Ferrers; your hoops are
cracked."</p>

<p>"Bah!" stormed Lieutenant Algy. "An
Army post is a crazy place for a fellow to go
when looking for sympathy or reason."</p>

<p>In the meantime A Company's men had spread
the joke through enlisted men's barracks.</p>

<p>"What's the use!" growled Private Hinkey to
a group of private soldiers. "Ferrers is just a
plumb fool, and all the colonels in the world
can't ever make anything else of him. Ferrers is
a born idiot!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Hal Overton paused just at the edge
of the group.</p>

<p>"Hinkey," the boyish non-com. observed
dryly, "if that's your opinion, you'll show a lot
of wisdom and good sense in keeping it to yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, you shut up!" sneered Hinkey. "No
one spoke to you. Move on. Your opinions are
not wanted here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Words cannot convey the intent in Hickey's
words, though it was plain enough to all who
stood near by.</p>

<p>Hinkey plainly sought to convey that no man
in barracks had any use for Sergeant Overton,
a man as good as convicted of having robbed
Private William Green.</p>

<p>Nor did Hal, by any means, miss the intended
slur. Yet he was above taking up any quarrel
on personal grounds.</p>

<p>"Hinkey," rebuked the young sergeant,
"you're not answering a non-commissioned officer
with the proper amount of respect."</p>

<p>"What's the use?" jeered the ugly soldier. "I
don't feel any."</p>

<p>"Silence, my man!"</p>

<p>"Then since you're putting on airs just because
of your chevrons, you'd better set an example
of silence yourself. Then your lesson
will wash down all the better."</p>

<p>The other soldiers in the group took no part
in the conversation. They did not attempt to
"show sides," but Sergeant Hal knew that they
were looking on and listening with keen interest.</p>

<p>It would never do for this boy who was a
sergeant to "back down" before such an affront,
both to himself and to good discipline.</p>

<p>"He's trying to make me mad, so that I'll
make it seem like a personal affair," thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Hal Overton swiftly. "I'll keep cool and fool
the fellow!"</p>

<p>Hinkey, after glaring defiantly and contemptuously
at the young sergeant, turned on
his heel and started away.</p>

<p>"Halt, there, my man!" ordered Sergeant
Hal coolly, yet at the same time sternly.</p>

<p>Hinkey kept on as though he had not heard.</p>

<p>Without an instant's hesitation, his manner
still cool but his face white and set, Sergeant
Overton leaped after his man, laying a hand
heavily on the private's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I halted you, my man!"</p>

<p>"Did you?" said Hinkey. "I didn't hear it."</p>

<p>With that, he slipped out from under Hal
Overton's detaining grasp, turned his back and
once more started onward.</p>

<p>"Careful there, Hinkey!" called one of the
soldiers warningly.</p>

<p>But the sullen soldier was now beyond any
sense of caution.</p>

<p>As Hal again grabbed him, this time with both
hands, and swinging him about, Hinkey thrust
his face menacingly close to Overton's.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Overton? Maybe I've
got it."</p>

<p>"Attention!"</p>

<p>"I'm listening," growled Hinkey, his whole
carriage slouching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand at attention!"</p>

<p>"Hinkey, you're wholly disrespectful and insubordinate!"</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye the soldier saw
his late companions silently drawing nearer.</p>

<p>"If I'm disrespectful, I'm disrespectful to
nothing!" he retorted derisively.</p>

<p>Then he added with more insulting directness:</p>

<p>"Or to less than nothing!"</p>

<p>"Hinkey, are you going to stand at attention
and be silent until I'm through with you?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Again he tried to free himself from the boyish
sergeant's grasp, but this time he found it
harder than he had expected.</p>

<p>"Stand at attention, man!"</p>

<p>"I'll see you in Tophet first! And take your
hands off of me, unless you want to start trouble
at once!"</p>

<p>"Hinkey, you are making a fearful mistake in
forgetting yourself! I'll give you this one
chance to come to your senses."</p>

<p>"And if you don't take your hands off of me
you'll lose your senses&mdash;if you ever had any!"</p>

<p>Hal's answer was to tighten his grip until
the other winced. Then Private Hinkey delivered
his answer. Suddenly wrenching himself
free, by the exercise of his full strength, he let
his fist fly at Sergeant Overton's face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>SERGEANT OVERTON AND DISCIPLINE</h3>


<div class='cap'>JUST how it all happened Private Hinkey
was never afterwards able to figure out
to his own satisfaction.</div>

<p>Instead of his blow landing, the soldier found
himself on his own back on the grass&mdash;and he
fell with a bump that jarred him.</p>

<p>"You chevroned cur! I'll make you eat that
blow!" yelled Hinkey, beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>Then he leaped to his feet, fairly quivering
with the great passion that had seized him.</p>

<p>"Slosson! Kelly! Take hold of Hinkey!
He's under arrest," announced the boyish sergeant.</p>

<p>Hinkey made a dive at Hal, but the two soldiers,
hearing themselves summoned, and knowing
the penalties of disobedience, threw themselves
between the sulky brute and the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Let me at him!" screamed Hinkey, struggling
with the two comrades who now held him.</p>

<p>"Be silent, you fool!" warned Slosson.
"You'll get yourself in stiff before you know
what you're about."</p>

<p>"What do I care?" panted Hinkey. "The
cur coward! He doesn't dare face me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the sergeant came at ye once wid his
fists, ye'd know better&mdash;as soon as ye knew anything,"
jeered Private Kelly.</p>

<p>"The sarge is a scrapper&mdash;few like him in
'ours' when he turns himself loose," supplemented
Slosson.</p>

<p>"Then let go of me, and let the cur turn himself
loose," pleaded Hinkey, fighting furiously
with his captors. "Let him show me if he
dares."</p>

<p>Into such a passion was he working himself
that Hinkey seemed likely to tear himself away
from the two soldiers who sought to restrain
him.</p>

<p>But Hal had sense enough to keep his own
hands out of the affair.</p>

<p>"Meade, get in there and help," he directed.</p>

<p>Then, with Hinkey growing rapidly angrier
and putting forth more strength, there was battle
royal.</p>

<p>When it was over Hinkey had a bleeding nose,
a cut lip, one eye closed and his uniform all
but torn from him.</p>

<p>But he panted and surrendered, at last&mdash;a
prisoner.</p>

<p>"What's this all about, Sergeant Overton?"
demanded First Sergeant Gray, hastening to the
spot.</p>

<p>"I've placed Hinkey under arrest, Sergeant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for disrespectful speech against an officer, for
disrespectful answers to myself and for insubordination."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't act without strong cause, I
know, Sergeant Overton," replied First Sergeant
Gray. "Hustle Private Hinkey down to
the guard house, then."</p>

<p>"Forward with him, men," ordered Hal.</p>

<p>Hinkey would have started the fight all over
again, but he realized the weight of discipline
and numbers, and felt that it would give his
enemy too much satisfaction.</p>

<p>So, with much growling and many oaths,
Hinkey submitted to being marched down to the
guard house.</p>

<p>To the sergeant of the guard Hal explained
the charge. The sergeant of the guard promptly
sent for Lieutenant Hayes, of C Company, who
was officer of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Hayes listened attentively to the charge
preferred by Sergeant Overton. Hinkey, too,
who was behind a barred door in one of the cells,
listened with darkening brow.</p>

<p>"It's all rot!" raged the arrested soldier.
"It's all a personal matter, and Overton has
vented his spite on me."</p>

<p>"Silence, my man!" ordered Lieutenant
Hayes sternly. "And when you refer to Sergeant
Overton, call him by his title.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>"</p>

<p>"I won't shut up until I've had my say!"
raged Private Hinkey, gripping with both
hands the bars of the cell door. "Lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, or you'll have disrespectful language
to the officer of the day added to the other
charges against you," warned Lieutenant
Hayes, stepping over to the cell door. "Not
another word out of you, Hinkey."</p>

<p>In the old days the prisoner would have been
locked up until the next general court-martial
convened. But in these newer days the plan
is to have as many offenses as possible tried
before summary court.</p>

<p>A summary court consists of one officer, who
must, when practicable, be of field officer's rank.</p>

<p>So, at nine the next morning, Private Hinkey
was arraigned before Major Silsbee. All the
necessary witnesses were there, too.</p>

<p>Hinkey, of course, claimed that it had all been
an affair of personal spite on the part of Sergeant
Overton.</p>

<p>This claim Hinkey was given a fair opportunity
to prove, but he failed to do so.</p>

<p>"I commend Sergeant Overton for his soldierly
attitude in the matter," declared Major
Silsbee when summing up. "Sergeant Overton
behaved with an amount of decision and of moderation
that is remarkable in so young a non-commissioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
officer. Sergeant Overton thereby
demonstrated his fitness to command men. Private
Hinkey's conduct, from start to finish, as
testified to by the witnesses, was gross and indefensible.
Such conduct in a soldier of the regular
Army is nothing short of disgraceful."</p>

<p>Then followed the sentence.</p>

<p>For disrespectful allusions to Lieutenant Ferrers,
uttered in the presence of other enlisted
men, Private Hinkey was sentenced to forfeit
fifteen dollars of his pay. For disrespect and
insubordination, as evinced toward Sergeant
Overton, and for resisting arrest, he was fined
twenty-five dollars more of his pay.</p>

<p>Thus Private Hinkey would be obliged to
work for the United States for nothing during
nearly the next three months of his service.</p>

<p>Further, he was sentenced to one week's confinement
at the guard house, and to perform
fatigue labor on the post.</p>

<p>Then, still under guard, Hinkey was marched
back to the guard house.</p>

<p>His sentence, which, of course, the fellow regarded
as tyranny pure and simple, filled his
heart with black hatred against the boyish sergeant.
At first sight it may seem strange, but
the outcome of the whole affair was to raise
Hal Overton considerably in the esteem of his
comrades at Fort Clowdry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>As his service in the Army lengthens the soldier
acquires a trained sense of justice.</p>

<p>A non-commissioned officer is never allowed
to lay hands in anger on any man beneath him
in rank, save to restrain a drunken or crazy
man, or in defense of himself or of another non-com.
or officer.</p>

<p>But Hinkey had struck at Hal, and the latter,
had he been so inclined, would have been
justified in leaping upon the private and beating
him into submission. Instead, he had ordered
disinterested soldiers to bring about the
submission and the arrest.</p>

<p>More, Major Silsbee's comments on the case
had been repeated by the witnesses to other
comrades in barracks.</p>

<p>A soldier soon comes to realize, if he is a
reasonable man, that his officers always endeavor
to work out impartial justice. Therefore,
Major Silsbee's comments had greatly
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'strenghtened'">strengthened</ins> Hal's reputation among his soldier
comrades.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all suspicion against
Sergeant Overton was forgotten, but the men
now remembered that Hinkey had been the most
active and bitter poisoner of minds against Hal.
So, now, reaction had its natural effect&mdash;somewhat
in Hal Overton's favor.</p>

<p>The fourth day of Hinkey's imprisonment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Sergeant Hal had charge of the guard that
controlled the seven prisoners, in all, who were
now working out guard house terms.</p>

<p>Hinkey now managed to come close to the
young sergeant in command of the fatigue
party.</p>

<p>"You may think you've won out," growled
Private Hinkey.</p>

<p>"My man," spoke Hal almost kindly, "I've
no desire to see you get into more trouble. Attend
to your fatigue duty!"</p>

<p>"You may think you've won out," repeated
Hinkey. "But wait!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>WHEN HINKEY WON GOOD OPINIONS</h3>


<div class='cap'>GREAT news came to Fort Clowdry these
days.</div>

<p>All summer the War Department had
been considering the advisability of holding a
military tournament at Denver. An enormous
religious organization of young people of both
sexes was to hold its convention in that city.</p>

<p>In the same week two great secret societies
were also to hold annual meetings in Denver.</p>

<p>Thus there would be an unusually large crowd
in this handsome, hustling city of the Rockies.</p>

<p>The War Department, in its efforts to conduct
the Army like any other great business enterprise,
occasionally "advertises" in the way
of holding a military tournament.</p>

<p>These tournaments, at which seats are provided
for many thousands of spectators, show
in graphic splendor the work of all the different
branches of the military service.</p>

<p>It is the experience of the War Department
that each tournament, if held under conditions
that will draw a huge crowd of spectators, always
results in a rush of the most desirable recruits
for the Army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Soldiers always take a keen interest in these
tournaments. It means to them the excitement
of travel and change, and the prospect of winning
applause that is so dear to the average
human heart.</p>

<p>It also means, for men of known good conduct,
a welcome amount of leave to wander
about the big city on the outskirts of which the
tournament is held. There are many other reasons
why men of the Regular Army always welcome
these affairs.</p>

<p>All four of the companies at Fort Clowdry
were to go to Denver, save for a detail of ten
men from each company, who were to be left
behind to guard government property at the
fort.</p>

<p>"Hinkey," announced Captain Cortland,
meeting that sullen soldier, "I don't suppose
you have figured on being allowed to go to Denver
with your company."</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, that I'm slated for the post
guard," replied Hinkey, saluting.</p>

<p>"My man, you've recently been guilty of conduct
grossly unbecoming a soldier. But you've
served your guard house period, and you'll be
busy, for many weeks yet to come, in working
out the fines imposed against you. For breaches
of discipline it is the intent of the authorities
to provide sufficient punishment. It is not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
however, the purpose to keep on punishing a
man. You may be glad, therefore, to know that
you are to be allowed to go to Denver with your
company."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; I am glad," replied Private
Hinkey, saluting very respectfully.</p>

<p>"Then look carefully to your conduct until
the time comes to start," admonished Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I most certainly shall."</p>

<p>Then, as he watched the back of Captain Cortland,
a peculiarly disagreeable smile came to
Hinkey's lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll be careful!" he muttered.
"And I am glad of the chance&mdash;far more glad
than you can guess, Cap. A trip like this will
give me ten times the chance I'd have here at
Clowdry to get even with that cheeky young
kid sergeant, Overton!"</p>

<p>Thereafter Hinkey fairly dreamed of the military
journey that was so near at hand.</p>

<p>All was bustle and activity on the military
reservation. Soldiers taking part in a military
tournament require almost as many "properties"
and "stage settings" as are needed by a
big theatrical company.</p>

<p>For the tournament is, actually and purposely,
a big theatrical display. It is intended to show
all the excitement, snap and glamour of the soldier's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
life and his deeds of high skill and great
daring.</p>

<p>Then came the day when the battalion, with
drum-major and band at its head, marched away
with colors bravely flying, and boarded the train
at the little, nearby station.</p>

<p>The train left soon after nine in the morning.</p>

<p>Private Hinkey was greatly disappointed at
this. He had hoped that the command might
travel by night. He had dreamed of catching
Sergeant Hal on a platform, and of hurling him
from the moving car without his crime being
seen of other eyes.</p>

<p>"But no matter!" muttered the brute to himself.
"I know the programme at the tournament,
and there'll be a lot of chances&mdash;more
than I can use, as I need but one!" the sullen
fellow finished grimly under his breath.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the train
was shunted upon a siding not far from the
great ball grounds on which the tourney was to
be held. There was no crowd here as yet, and
no crashing of brass or flourish of trumpets.
The battalion, at route step, moved into the
grounds. Here ranks were broken and arms
stacked. Then, by detachments, each under an
officer, or non-commissioned officer, the men were
hustled off to attend to an enormous amount of
swift, skilful labor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>At one far-end of the grounds the full-sized
Army tents were erected, with cook tents, mess
and hospital tents, and all, for the men were to
live comfortably in the brief time that they
were to be here.</p>

<p>Engineer and cavalry troops were already on
the field, the engineers having arrived first of
all, in order to lay the grounds out for the work
in hand. Artillery and Signal Corps men, and
a small detachment of ordnance troops, were
due to arrive before dark.</p>

<p>By supper time the hard-worked soldiers had
some right to feel tired. It was not until nine
in the evening that the men were through for
that day. Then a few of the men of best conduct
were given passes to leave camp and visit
Denver until midnight.</p>

<p>Private Hinkey was not one of these men.
He did not even want to go, for he had worked
like a beaver, and was thoroughly tired out.
It had seemed, since reaching the grounds, as
though Hinkey had been determined to show
how good and industrious a soldier he could be.</p>

<p>"That man is working to reinstate himself
in the good conduct grade," remarked Lieutenant
Hampton, calling Hinkey's tireless industry
to Captain Cortland's attention.</p>

<p>"Then he'll have all the chance he wants,"
replied the captain. "We don't want to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
any man down, or to give him a dog's name&mdash;with
apologies to the dog."</p>

<p>As Hinkey had been in a service detachment
under Overton's command Hal felt it but just
to say to the fellow:</p>

<p>"Hinkey, you've worked harder and more
attentively than any man in this detachment."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sergeant; I've tried to," replied
the fellow, with such well-pretended respect
that Sergeant Hal almost fell over.</p>

<p>"I almost think I've misjudged the man in
thinking him one of our worst," Overton told
himself.</p>

<p>It had been well for the boyish young sergeant
had he been but a trifle more suspicious
of such sudden reform on his enemy's part!</p>

<p>At five in the morning, or almost an hour
earlier than usual, every officer and man in this
temporary camp was routed out from under his
blankets by the sharp, stirring notes of first call
to reveille.</p>

<p>Breakfast was hurriedly disposed of, and the
simple duties of ordinary "camp police" performed
by the time that it was fully light.</p>

<p>And now more labor, for the stage settings
must be arranged, that they might all be moved
swiftly into place as the need came.</p>

<p>It was noon when the men finished. Then
mess call, or "come and get it," as the soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
facetiously term it, was sounded over the camp,
and officer and man alike hastened to the well-earned
midday meal.</p>

<p>"We ought to have a huge crowd," spoke
Corporal Noll Terry, at camp table.</p>

<p>"We ought to, but we won't," predicted Sergeant
Hupner.</p>

<p>"Why not, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"You didn't take a pass to go to town, last
night?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Well, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"The town is billed from one end to another
with posters of the show," continued Hupner.</p>

<p>"Meaning our tournament?"</p>

<p>"No, Terry. Of course, our show is billed,
too, but the show I'm alluding to is Howe and
Spangleton's Great Combined Circuses."</p>

<p>"Are they showing in Denver to-day?" asked
Sergeant Overton.</p>

<p>"Yes, siree," replied Hupner, with emphasis.
"And you know what these western towns are
when a truly big circus works this far west.
The circus will be selling standing-room at
double prices, and this show of ours will be
performed to two or three hundred small kids
whose hearts are broken because they didn't
have the price of a circus ticket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"We ought to have had some other date in
the week, then," spoke up another man at table.</p>

<p>"Oh," grimaced Hupner, "the War Department
thinks a whole lot of its regulars, of
course, so I don't suppose any one over at Washington
could picture the troops being called
upon to show their best work to empty benches
that would hold twenty thousand spectators."</p>

<p>That same news, and that same impression
had reached the artillery, the cavalry, the ordnance
detachment, the engineers and the men
of the Signal Corps. The officers, likewise,
shook their heads. All were greatly disappointed
to think that the Army had to compete
with the sawdust, the tinsel, the gay music
and the dash and whoop-la of the circus.</p>

<p>Yet one man in this Regular Army encampment
felt wholly satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>That man was Private Hinkey.</p>

<p>He knew the programme of the tournament,
and the secret of this sullen wretch's great industry
was known at least to himself.</p>

<p>"I've got it all fixed to rid the regiment of
that kid sergeant," the brute in uniform exulted
to himself. "Exit Kid Overton from the
Thirty-fourth!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>HAL RIDES INTO TREACHERY</h3>


<div class='cap'>AT one-thirty the gates of the ball grounds
were thrown open.</div>

<p>A long programme lay before the assembled
regulars, so the tournament was to begin
at two o'clock.</p>

<p>The same performance was to be repeated in
the evening, under brilliant electric lighting.</p>

<p>As they left the camp tables, however, the
men moved about rather dejectedly.</p>

<p>The unexpected competition with the big circus
had spoiled their hopes of winning round
after round of delighted applause from huge
crowds.</p>

<p>Yet barely were the gates to the grounds open
when the soldiers began to take notice.</p>

<p>In an instant after opening there was a big
rush at the gates. Men and women, boys and
girls, crowded and jostled to get into the
grounds.</p>

<p>"They'll stop coming in two minutes, at this
rate," grumbled Sergeant Hupner.</p>

<p>Yet he proved a poor prophet. By quarter
of two nearly <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'everyone'">every one</ins> of the more than twenty
thousand seats for spectators had been filled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Five minutes after that not a seat could be had,
even by squeezing. Just before two o'clock ten
thousand more spectators had crowded in, standing
wherever they could find the space.</p>

<p>Outside the crowd still pressed. Thousands
simply had to be turned away.</p>

<p>Every officer present now wore a quiet smile
that hid his delight under an orderly appearance.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the circus has a crowd like
this?" gasped Sergeant Hupner, his astonished
gaze roving over the densely packed masses of
humanity.</p>

<p>An artillery band was playing at its loudest
and gayest.</p>

<p>"I wonder," repeated Sergeant Hupner, "if
the circus is playing to a crush like this."</p>

<p>No; it wasn't. Over under the Howe and
Spangleton big-top, with its plain and reserved
seats for eighteen thousand people, consternation
prevailed.</p>

<p>The Army had proved the winning attraction
for Denver's amusement-seeking crowds!</p>

<p>Only some eleven hundred and fifty people
had paid to see the afternoon performance at the
circus. In chagrin, the management hurriedly
passed in free some two hundred more loungers
on the lot.</p>

<p>"I never even dreamed of a streak of luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
like this!" grumbled Proprietor Howe to his
partner, Spangleton.</p>

<p>"I hope we'll never meet it again. What has
struck us this blow under the belt?"</p>

<p>"The confounded regular Army," growled
Howe. "I've just telephoned over, and I hear
that folks are packed in so tightly at the Army
show that the people are able to breathe only
half the usual number of times to the minute."</p>

<p>"Then they'll hit us just as bad to-night,"
growled Spangleton. "Howe, with the Army
to play against, we'd save money by pulling
down our tents now and striking the rails for
the next stand."</p>

<p>Just a minute or so before two o'clock the artillery
band left the bandstand and marched
back to camp.</p>

<p>Now, all in an instant, the military parade
formed.</p>

<p>At the head was the cavalry band, followed
by a squadron (two troops or companies) of
splendidly mounted fighting men, their accoutrements
jingling.</p>

<p>As the cavalry, its band blaring joyously,
passed out before the people, the Signal Corps
men followed on foot. Now the artillery, preceded
by a mounted band that was just now
silent, swung into line. Right behind the artillery,
with its men perched up on the seats, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
arms folded, or else driving the horses from
saddles, came more men on foot, the ordnance
detachment.</p>

<p>Now a third band, the Thirty-fourth's,
marched on to the scene, silent, like the artillery
musicians. After the third band in the line
came the first battalion of the Thirty-fourth&mdash;at
its head Colonel North and Major Silsbee,
with their respective staffs, all on horseback.
And now behind them marched, with the precise,
easy rhythm of the foot soldier, the four
companies, A, B, C and D, all moving like so
many fine, automatic, easy-jointed machines.</p>

<p>The mounted detachments had brought forth
rounds of rousing applause as they swept by,
but when the infantrymen&mdash;the real, solid,
fighting wall of the Army came in view, its
men moving with the perfectly gaited, steady
whump, whump! of superbly marching men, the
spectators began to yell in frantic earnest.</p>

<p>The cavalry band ceased its stirring strain.
Instantly the mounted drum major of the artillery
swung about on his horse, holding up his
baton, then bringing it down with the signal,
"play."</p>

<p>As the artillery band blazed forth in a glory
of rousing melody the noise of people's feet
increased.</p>

<p>By the time that the infantry marched past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the central portion of the great mass of civilians
it was the turn of the Thirty-fourth's band.
Every spectator, nearly, was now standing,
stamping, waving. Cheer after cheer went up.</p>

<p>It seemed as though human enthusiasm could
not know greater bounds. Faint echoes must
have reached the distant, nearly empty circus
big-top. Yet the breathless thousands had
caught, as yet, but the first tame pageantry of
this glimpse of the glory of armed men.</p>

<p>Just before B company, as it swung along at
the good old regular gait, one excited onlooker
hurled a well-filled wallet&mdash;the only sign left
him for showing his utter enthusiasm.</p>

<p>File after file of foot soldiers stepped over
this wallet, yet, if one of the infantrymen knew
it was there, not one of them let any sign escape
him. Discipline was absolutely perfect. These
marching men of rifle and bayonet swept on,
heads up, eyes straight forward, every file in
flawless, absolute alignment.</p>

<p>And so the wallet was passed over and left
behind while the crowd, staring at this unexpected
scene of soldierly discipline, went wilder
than before, in a frantic acclaim that was
granted from the soul.</p>

<p>A policeman, standing at the edge of the
crowd, picked up the wallet, returning it to its
somewhat disappointed owner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When the parade had swept around the field,
each band playing in its turn, the crowd settled
back with a sigh, as though satisfied that the
greatest sight on the programme had been witnessed.</p>

<p>Yet hardly was there a pause. A troop
of cavalry came forward, now, at the trot. All
the evolutions of the school of the troop,
mounted, were now gone through with. All
the swift, bewildering changes of the cavalryman's
manual of arms were exhibited.</p>

<p>Single riders and squads exhibited some of
the prettiest work of the cowboy, for the American
cavalryman has learned his riding and his
daring from the best work of generations of
cowboys.</p>

<p>Men rode two, and then three horses, at once,
standing on bareback and leaping their animals
over gates, ditches and hedges.</p>

<p>Down at the far end of the wheel a squad
of cavalrymen halted, dismounted, unlimbered
their carbines, and began firing at a squad of
cavalrymen who galloped toward them from the
other extremity of the field. Three of the men
fired upon toppled and fell from their saddles to
the dust with wonderful realism, while startled
"ohs!" came from the eager onlookers.</p>

<p>Just behind this detachment rode more cavalrymen
at the gallop. Three of these men, without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
seeming effort, swung down from their saddles,
while their mounts still galloped, picked
up the "dead or wounded," and then these
horses, guided by their riders, wheeled and
made fast time with the mock "casualties" to
the rear.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight. Now, the audience
began to come somewhere near its actual limits
of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Other yet more wonderful feats of skill and
precision by the cavalry followed. Ere the
"yellow-legs" had retired, momentarily, from
the field of display, every small boy in the crowd&mdash;and
many a large one&mdash;had decided that the
life of the trooper must be his.</p>

<p>Then the flying artillery came on to the field,
amid clouds of dust, the urgings of drivers, the
sharp commands of officers and the pealing commands
of bugles. For the first time in their
lives the spectators realized how like lightning
the American artillery moves, and how speedily
it gets into deadly action. It was a pity that
none of the fine marksmanship with the field
cannon could be shown. The audience had to
be satisfied with salvo after salvo fired with
blank cartridges at imaginary enemies.</p>

<p>Then next the scene swiftly changed to a well-simulated
one of battle, in which all arms engaged.
"Under heavy fire" the engineers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
threw a bridge swiftly across a wide ditch representing
a stream. While this was going on
Signal Corps men laid wires and had telephone
and telegraph instruments in operation from the
firing line to the rear.</p>

<p>More of it came when the squadron of cavalry,
at one end of the field, and backed by the signal
and ordnance detachments, now bearing
rifles, impersonated a hostile advance, firing
volleys and "at will" at the artillery and infantry,
posted to repulse them.</p>

<p>It took the breath of the spectators away.
For now they gazed upon the grim realities of
war, save for the actual deaths and manglings
which all knew must follow such fierce firing
when done in reality.</p>

<p>It was some minutes afterward before the
smoke cleared away from over the field sufficiently
to allow all to see the next spectacles.
But all onlookers now felt the need of a brief
rest from such sensations.</p>

<p>There were a host of features to the rousing
programme, and not a spectator but thrilled and
throbbed, and thanked his lucky stars that he
was here, at the show, the spectacle of a lifetime!</p>

<p>Feature after feature followed, in a swiftly-moving,
tightly-packed programme lasting three
hours. The riot drill, showing with vivid effect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
how a battalion of regular infantry can
move through a densely packed mob, brought
forth tumultuous cheers. When the cheering
had subsided such shouts as these were offered
by excited spectators:</p>

<p>"Bring your anarchists here to-night, and
show them this!"</p>

<p>"Never get into a riot unless you go with the
regulars!"</p>

<p>It was truly an Army afternoon. All such
afternoons are, for the average American knows
truly nothing about his own Army. When he
sees it actually at work he becomes, for the time
at least, an "Army crank."</p>

<p>There were many features in which only one,
or a few men, figured importantly. One of these
was now about to be offered. On the programme
it bore the title, "the bicycle dispatch
rider."</p>

<p>No name was set opposite this title, but the
man who had been selected for the work was
Sergeant Hal Overton.</p>

<p>At the far side of the field the scene had been
arranged. It represented a hill road, over
which the dispatch bearer must ride at breakneck
speed. For picturesque purposes Hal wore
a surgeon's field case, hanging over one shoulder
by a strap. In actual war time his real dispatches
would have been hidden somewhere in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his clothing, his shoes, or what-not place of concealment.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the Thirty-fourth's band turned
loose into a dashing gallop played at faster time
than usual. It was the signal for Sergeant Hal
to mount his wheel and ride as for life.</p>

<p>Something in the speed, the dash, the evident
purpose of the young soldier caught the hearts
of the spectators as soon as Hal started. He
had not gone fifty yards on his way before the
cheering once more burst forth.</p>

<p>At the outset were some little gaps in the
path, representing brooks and rills. Over these
Sergeant Hal sped as if they did not exist, while
little upward spurts of water helped out the illusion.</p>

<p>Ahead of the young military bicyclist now
appeared a plain fence, some four feet high.
Hal Overton rode at this with all the speed his
flying feet could impart to the pedals. He appeared
bent on violent collision with the fence.</p>

<p>Indeed, he rode at the palings as though he
could not stop. Yet, when almost in the act of
collision, Sergeant Hal made a flying leap from
his wheel, which he tossed over the fence. In
two incredibly swift movements he was over the
fence. His wheel hardly seemed to have fallen
at all, so swiftly did the young sergeant have it
going again. He made a flying leap to the saddle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and was again pedaling desperately, while
five or six shots to the rear filled out the illusion
of a dispatch bearer being pursued by enemies.</p>

<p>That trick at the fence instantly took hold of
the younger male portion of the audience. Denver
boys saw wherein young soldiers were
taught things about bicycle riding that were not
known among civilians.</p>

<p>Hardly was Sergeant Hal going at full speed
again when another obstacle loomed up in his
way. This was an intrenchment front, sloping
as he approached it, but with a sheer drop of
some three feet on the other side.</p>

<p>Straight up the slope dashed Hal Overton.
For a fraction of a second, as he left the top of
the barrier, his wheel looked more like an odd
airship, but now the forward wheel struck the
ground beyond once more, the rear wheel swiftly
following, and the dispatch rider was going onward
faster than ever.</p>

<p>The small boys now led in the noise that came
from the spectators' seats.</p>

<p>Just ahead lay the greatest peril of the path
for the military dispatch rider. Here, in the
hill scene, had been cut an actual gully, some
eighteen feet deep, and fully twelve feet across.</p>

<p>Just a few minutes before a squad of soldiers
had placed across this gully the trunk of a tree,
shorn of its limbs and trimmed down close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>As Sergeant Hal now approached this tree
trunk, which was not, at its thickest part, more
than a foot in diameter, his purpose dawned
upon the watching thousands.</p>

<p>This tree trunk represented the only possible
way of getting over the gully.</p>

<p>Surely, the young rider would slow down, dismount,
take the wheel on his shoulders and
cross the slim bridge on foot.</p>

<p>But the crackling out of more shots behind
him told the onlookers that the young dispatch
rider in Uncle Sam's khaki uniform must make
great haste.</p>

<p>Hal lay on harder than ever on his pedals.
His speed carried to the onlookers the reality
of a desperate race of life and death.</p>

<p>Close to the nearer edge of the gully stood a
solitary figure, that of Corporal Noll Terry, who
had had charge of the men laying the tree trunk
across the gully.</p>

<p>Noll still stood by, watching, ready to be at
hand if anything happened. One other man
watched, though from a considerable distance.</p>

<p>This man was Private Hinkey, who alone
knew the secret of his willing industry since
reaching this camp.</p>

<p>Hinkey, unseen by others, had managed
treacherously to "fix" the log in a manner that
had defied detection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 297px;">

<span class="caption">Sergeant Hal&#39;s Forward Wheel Struck the Log.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"There'll be an end to the sergeant kid, in
two seconds more!" gloated the rascal.</p>

<p>Sergeant's Hal's forward wheel struck the
log, throwing full weight upon it. There was
a snapping crackle, then a shriek from thousands.</p>

<p>For the log had snapped in two, and Sergeant
Hal Overton, thrown head downward, was on
his way to a broken neck at the bottom of the
gully.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>CHASING A SPEEDING DESERTER</h3>


<div class='cap'>INSTEAD of one, there were two flying
bodies headed toward the gully's bottom.
Corporal Noll Terry, standing there, had
heard the ominous crackle of snapping wood.</div>

<p>If there is one thing that a soldier is taught
above another, it is to think and move swiftly
at a critical moment.</p>

<p>Noll saw the tree trunk sag downward, in just
the fraction of a second ere it broke.</p>

<p>Nor did Corporal Terry wait to see more.</p>

<p>With his eyes on his bunkie, Terry made a
prompt leap downward.</p>

<p>He had the advantage of landing on his feet.
He was jarred, but there was no time to stop to
think of that.</p>

<p>At a bound he was far enough forward, his
arms outstretched, to swing hold of head-downward
Hal Overton.</p>

<p>The impact might have been too much. Sergeant
Hal might even yet have landed on his
head. But, as he threw him arms around Hal,
Corporal Terry threw himself over backward.</p>

<p>He fell with a thump, but was shaken up&mdash;no
bones broken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Sergeant Hal landed on top of his bunkie
unhurt.</p>

<p>In an instant they separated, each leaping to
his feet.</p>

<p>The falling halves of the tree trunk had fallen
perilously close to the boyish non-coms., yet by
a stroke of good fortune neither of the comrades
had been struck.</p>

<p>"Thank you, old bunkie! The best ever!"
glowed Hal, as without a backward look he raced
to pick up his wheel. "Hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," gasped Noll, his wind jarred
out of him for the moment.</p>

<p>"Then I'll finish the ride!"</p>

<p>To the thrilled, throbbing spectators there did
not come a thought of "accident."</p>

<p>Clearly this whole splendid scene had been
only a glimpse of practical military training.</p>

<p>It had all been planned, of course, so the
audience supposed, that the tree trunk should
snap and that the other young sergeant should
be there to perform the swift work of rescue.</p>

<p>Even at that it was a wonderful sight, and
again the spectators were on their feet, cheering
more hoarsely than ever.</p>

<p>Yet hardly had they started to cheer when,
some how, in a way they did not quite grasp,
Sergeant Hal Overton had climbed up out of
the gully, carrying his wheel with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Now he was mounted again! On the further
side of the gully the young Army dispatch rider
was racing forward again.</p>

<p>His wheel, somewhat damaged by the fall,
was moving stiffly now, but Overton put into
his pedaling every ounce of energy left to him.</p>

<p>In another moment he was out of sight, his
dispatch-bearing ride ended, and the band leader
stopped his musicians.</p>

<p>In this startling scene the onlookers felt that
they had viewed the best piece of individual
daring of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Little did they guess that they had seen the
failure of a scoundrel's dastardly attempt to
end Sergeant Overton's life.</p>

<p>But grizzled old Colonel North, of the Thirty-fourth
United States Infantry, knew better.</p>

<p>"Cortland," he remarked, turning to B Company's
captain, "just as soon as the last number
is over I want you to make an instant and
red-hot investigation of that accident to Sergeant
Overton. Report to me as soon as you
have even the trace of a suggestion to make."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and I have one suggestion to make
now," replied Captain Cortland.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I ask you, sir, to oblige me very greatly
by promising a warrant at once for Corporal
Terry's promotion to sergeant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Jove, young Terry earned it!" agreed
Colonel North.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and, to my way of thinking, he
did more. He proved that B Company cannot
afford to be without a sergeant of his proved
calibre."</p>

<p>"Go to Wright, the battalion adjutant, then,
and tell him, with my compliments, to prepare
an order at once, for reading at the dress parade
which is to end up the afternoon's show."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"And, Cortland, ask Wright, as a personal
favor to me, to read the order slowly and distinctly,
so that the audience can grasp the fact
that they've witnessed a deed of heroism and
its prompt reward in the Army."</p>

<p>"A splendid idea, sir!"</p>

<p>At the close of the afternoon's fast and furious
work came a spectacle such as doubtless no
one in the audience had ever seen before.</p>

<p>The three fighting arms of the service&mdash;artillery,
cavalry and infantry&mdash;combined at dress
parade.</p>

<p>The ceremony, as enacted that afternoon, possessed
all the fervor and solemnity of a religious
rite.</p>

<p>When it came to the publication of orders appointing
Corporal Oliver Terry a sergeant in
recognition of unusual bravery and judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in saving a comrade's life, only a small percentage
of the on-looking, listening thousands
grasped the importance or meaning of the promotion
of one young soldier.</p>

<p>No matter! All would read about it in the
Denver papers the next morning.</p>

<p>At the firing of retreat gun three military
bands combined in the playing of "The Star
Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>Then, as the troops marched off, all was over
as far as the audience was concerned.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland, however, had no sooner
dismissed his company than he turned back to
the field, to go to the gully to investigate the
matter of the broken log. Lieutenant Prescott
went with him.</p>

<p>Over back of one of the cook tents, however,
a plain soldier man was already arriving at
the truth.</p>

<p>"Hinkey, come over here!" called Private
Slosson.</p>

<p>There was something in this soldier's voice
which made Private Hinkey feel that perhaps
it would not be altogether wise to disregard
this request that sounded so much to him like
an order.</p>

<p>"Hinkey," continued Private Slosson, "'twas
a near escape from breaking his neck that Sergeant
Overton had this afternoon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's no concern of mine, I guess," murmured
Hinkey.</p>

<p>"Then it ought to be," retorted Private Slosson
with considerable warmth. "Hinkey, you
had me guessing yesterday and this forenoon,
you were so full of industry. And that put me
in mind. I saw you coming down from near
the gully this morning, and you had something
hidden under your coat."</p>

<p>The fingers that held Hinkey's cigarette began
to tremble.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Slosson?"</p>

<p>"Well, first of all, the thing you had under
your coat was a saw. I saw you hide something
under the woodpile here, but I'm so dumb that
I didn't think much of it at the time. Now, the
log over the gully was a spruce log, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, I do," replied Slosson, "and we
haven't been using much spruce timber around
here, either. So I looked over the saw. Hinkey,
between the teeth is quite a little bit of what
looks mighty like spruce sawdust. Queer, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Private Hinkey,
speaking bravely, though his face now looked
bloodless and his lips were quivering.</p>

<p>"Spruce sawdust in the saw you handled,"
continued Slosson mercilessly. "And say, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
saw cut in the log over at the gully was pasted
with putty, and then bark bits stuck on, to hide
the cut. Wasn't that the way it was done?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" snarled Private
Hinkey, trying to glare back into the accusing
eyes of Private Slosson.</p>

<p>"Why I asked," continued the latter soldier,
"was because I've just been taking a look at
the service clothes you wore this morning, and
I find putty marks in several places on the
trousers."</p>

<p>Hinkey realized that he had been unmasked.
Moreover, only one look into Slosson's eyes was
needed for making sure that the accusing soldier
was not going to keep still about it.</p>

<p>With a sudden snarl of rage, Hinkey sprang
forward, driving his hard right fist squarely
into Slosson's left eye and knocking that soldier
down.</p>

<p>Then, without loss of a second, Hinkey made
a dive for the nearest gate of the grounds. As
he ran at top speed Private Hinkey then and
there, so far as he was personally concerned,
ended his connection with the regular Army of
the United States.</p>

<p>Private Slosson, holding his eye and feeling
weak and dizzy, shouted:</p>

<p>"Some one run after Hinkey, B Company,
and catch him!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The call brought several men, among them
Lieutenant Hampton, of B Company.</p>

<p>"What has Hinkey done?" demanded the lieutenant,
running up.</p>

<p>"He knocked me down, and then deserted,
sir."</p>

<p>"Why, my man?"</p>

<p>"Because he fixed the tree trunk in the way
that nearly cost Sergeant Overton his life, and
I just showed Hinkey that I had all the proof.
You'll not see the fellow again, sir, unless you're
swift."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hampton bounded to the gateway.
Down the street he saw Private Hinkey, running
like a deer and already near a street corner.</p>

<p>Hal Overton was the only sergeant close
enough for the lieutenant's purpose.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Overton, take four men, pursue
Hinkey and bring him back here," ordered Lieutenant
Hampton.</p>

<p>Hal reached the gateway just in time to see
Hinkey running around the street corner.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Hal and four soldiers were hot-foot
after the suspected deserter.</p>

<p>But Hinkey was out of sight now. As he
reached the middle of the block into which he
had turned, a man in his shirt sleeves, standing
idly in a doorway called out softly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jump in behind me, comrade, if you're in
trouble and being chased."</p>

<p>Hinkey stopped pantingly, giving the man a
swift look. That glance was enough to show the
deserting soldier that he had met a kindred
spirit.</p>

<p>"Thanks. I'll accept," muttered Hinkey,
darting into the doorway.</p>

<p>The man who had hailed him pulled the door
shut just before Sergeant Hal and four soldiers
ran around the corner above.</p>

<p>"What's that soldier been doing that ran by
here so fast?" called the citizen in shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?" asked Hal swiftly,
halting just an instant.</p>

<p>"See the next corner?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Your man turned there&mdash;to the left. You
fellows will have to double your speed if you're
ever going to catch that soldier."</p>

<p>"Put on all the steam you can, men," Hal
called back over his shoulder as he once more
started in what he believed to be pursuit.</p>

<p>Chuckling softly, the citizen opened the door,
closed it again and went inside to tell Hinkey
why he had saved him.</p>

<p>It was a full hour before Sergeant Hal Overton
again reported back at camp on the
grounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He had come back at last, forced to admit himself
baffled.</p>

<p>"You did all you could, Sergeant," replied
Captain Cortland, who had just returned to the
company street. "Hinkey will be caught, sooner
or later."</p>

<p>Then, turning to First Sergeant Gray, who
had just come up, Captain Cortland smiled as
he added:</p>

<p>"Sergeant Gray, I wonder if Hinkey is still
running. If he runs long enough he'll probably
fall in with some muck-raking magazine
writer, who'll get out of Hinkey a startling story
of why some soldiers insist on deserting the
Army."</p>

<p>"Captain," replied Sergeant Gray, "I could
tell those magazine writers a good deal about
why men desert from the Army, sir. But the
magazine writers wouldn't want my story of
why men desert."</p>

<p>"What would your story be, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I'd tell those writers&mdash;and prove
it by the records&mdash;that the men who desert from
the Army are the same worthless, skulking vagabonds
who are always getting bounced out of
jobs in civil life because they're no good anywhere."</p>

<p>"That's the whole story, Sergeant Gray,"
nodded Captain Cortland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it, sir; I haven't been in the Army
all these years not to have found out that much."</p>

<p>Just then Noll Terry appeared on the scene,
wearing his newly won sergeant's chevrons.</p>

<p>Captain Cortland's inquiry into the cause of
the accident to Sergeant Overton was concluded
by taking the sworn testimony of Private Slosson.
The papers were then filed away to be
used in case the deserter Hinkey should be apprehended.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ALGY COMES TO A CONCLUSION</h3>


<div class='cap'>HINKEY, secure in his new retreat, with
a new-found "friend" who wanted the
services of a man of Hinkey's stripe,
was not found.</div>

<p>The evening programme of the military
tournament was carried out before all the spectators
who could wedge themselves into the
grounds, and once more the big circus played to
a small crowd.</p>

<p>In the morning the Thirty-fourth entrained
and returned to Fort Clowdry.</p>

<p>While in Denver, Lieutenant Ferrers, though
he had accompanied the battalion, had been employed
in duties that kept him out of the public
eye.</p>

<p>Once back at the post, however, Ferrers was
warned by both battalion and regimental commanders
that he must buckle down at once to
learn his duties as an officer.</p>

<p>"I had an idea that being an officer was a
good deal more of a gentleman's job," Algy
sighed to Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"An officer's position in the Army is a hard-working
job," Prescott rejoined. "However,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
there's nothing in that fact to make it difficult
for an officer to be a gentleman, too. In fact,
he must be an all-around gentleman, or get out
of the service."</p>

<p>"But gentlemen shouldn't be expected to work&mdash;at
least, not hard," argued Algy Ferrers.</p>

<p>"Now, where on earth did you get that idea?"
laughed Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"All the fellows I used to know were gentlemen,"
protested Algy, "and none of them ever
worked."</p>

<p>"Then what were they good for?" demanded
Lieutenant Prescott crisply.</p>

<p>"Eh?" breathed Ferrers, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"If they didn't work, if they didn't do anything
real in the world, what were they good
for? What was their excuse for wanting to
live?" insisted Prescott.</p>

<p>"Prexy, old chap, I'm afraid you're an anarchist,"
gasped Algy, looking almost humanly
distressed.</p>

<p>"No; you're the anarchist," laughed the
other lieutenant, "for no anarchist ever wants
to work. Come, now, Ferrers, buck up! Go
over the drill manual with me."</p>

<p>For two days Algy did seem inclined to
buckle down to the hard work of learning how
to command other men efficiently. Then one
night he fell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>That is to say, he went off the reservation
without notifying any of his superior officers.</p>

<p>At the sounding of drill assembly the next
morning, every officer on post was present with
the one exception of young Mr. Ferrers.</p>

<p>"Where's that hopeless idiot now?" muttered
Colonel North peevishly, for he had come down
to see the battalion drill.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea, sir," replied Major
Silsbee.</p>

<p>"Send an orderly up to his quarters, Major."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>But, as both major and colonel had suspected,
Ferrers wasn't in his quarters. Nor was he
anywhere else on post apparently.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock that afternoon when Lieutenant
Ferrers, in civilian dress, passed the
guard house in returning on post.</p>

<p>"Wanted&mdash;at the adjutant's office&mdash;am I?"
queried Algy. "Oh, yes; I imagine I am.
Queer place, this Army."</p>

<p>With a sigh of resignation, but appearing not
in the least alarmed, Ferrers went to the office
of the regimental adjutant.</p>

<p>"You've been away again without leave, and
skipped battalion drill and several other duties,"
said the adjutant dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Ferrers promptly. "But
I've got a good excuse."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll find Colonel North in the next room
ready to hear what your excuse can be."</p>

<p>"I suppose he'll scold me again," murmured
Algy resignedly.</p>

<p>"Yes; all of that," admitted the adjutant
dryly. "Better go in at once, and take your
medicine, for the colonel is about ready to leave
and go over to his house."</p>

<p>As Algy entered Colonel North's office the
older man lifted his head and looked rather
coldly at Mr. Ferrers.</p>

<p>Algy brought up his hand in a tardy salute,
then stood there.</p>

<p>But the colonel only continued to look at him.
Ferrers fidgeted until he could endure the
silence no longer.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you wanted to speak to me, sir?"
stammered Algy, the frigid atmosphere disconcerting
him.</p>

<p>"I never wanted to speak to a man less in
my life," rejoined Colonel North icily.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Then I'll be going."</p>

<p>"Stop, sir!"</p>

<p>"Eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferrers, I'll listen to whatever you
have to say."</p>

<p>"It's all about my being away to-day, I suppose,
sir," Algy went on lamely. What he had
considered a most excellent excuse on his part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
now suddenly struck him as being exceedingly
lame.</p>

<p>Again Colonel North's lips were tightly compressed.
He merely looked at this young officer,
but Algy found that look to be the same thing
as acute torment.</p>

<p>"Y-yes, sir; I was away to-day sir."</p>

<p>"Further than Clowdry, Mr. Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes, sir," admitted Algy promptly.
"Took the train, in fact, sir, and ran up to
Ridgecrest. The Benson-Bodges have a new
mountain estate of their own up there. Just
heard about it the other day, sir. Wrote Benson-Bodge
himself, and got a letter yesterday
evening. Old Bense invited me to come up and
visit himself and family, and not to stand on
ceremony. So I didn't."</p>

<p>"No; you didn't stand on any ceremony, Mr.
Ferrers," was the colonel's sarcastic response.
"Not even the ceremony of formality of obtaining
leave."</p>

<p>"But it was all right this time, sir. Quite all
right, sir," went on Algy Ferrers with more confidence.
"I rather think you know who the
Benson-Bodges are, sir? Most important people.
A man in the Army can't afford to ignore
them, sir&mdash;so I didn't."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about the people you
name, Mr. Ferrers, and I don't want to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, won't you?" demanded
Algy beamingly, "but for once I am quite certain
you are wrong, sir. Really an Army man
can't afford not to know the Benson-Bodges.
Old Bense is a cousin of the President. Old
Bense has tremendous influence at Washington."</p>

<p>"Then I wonder, Mr. Ferrers, if your friend
has influence enough at Washington to save
your shoulder-straps for you?"</p>

<p>"Eh, sir? What's that? What do you
mean, sir?" asked Algy, again looking puzzled
and uneasy.</p>

<p>"I am going to make my meaning very clear,
Mr. Ferrers. To-day's conduct is merely the
winding up affair of many discreditable pieces
of conduct in your part. You have proved,
conclusively, that you are not fit to be an officer
in the Army."</p>

<p>"Not fit to&mdash;&mdash;" repeated Algy slowly. Then
broke into a laugh as he added: "That's a good
joke, sir."</p>

<p>"Is it?" inquired Colonel North, raising his
eyebrows. "Then I trust that you will enjoy
every chapter in the joke, Mr. Ferrers. I am
going to order you to your quarters, in arrest.
And, as I'm afraid you don't really know what
arrest means, I'm going to place a sentry before
your door to see that you don't go out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"For how long, sir?"</p>

<p>"For as long as may be necessary, Mr. Ferrers.
Having placed you in arrest I shall report
your case through the usual military channels
and recommend that you be tried by a general
court-martial. I am of the opinion, Mr.
Ferrers, that the court-martial will find you
guilty and recommend that you be dishonorably
dismissed from the service."</p>

<p>"Dishonorably dis&mdash;&mdash;" gasped Algy, feeling
so weak that he suddenly dropped down
into a chair, unbidden. "Gracious! But that
will strike the guv'nor hard! See here, sir,"
the impossible young officer went on, more spiritedly,
as he realized the impending disgrace,
"if you're going to do anything as beastly and
rough as that, sir&mdash;pardon, sir&mdash;then I won't
stand for it!"</p>

<p>"What will you do, then?" demanded North.</p>

<p>"Sooner than stand for being tried, like an
ordinary pickpocket, Colonel, I'll resign!"</p>

<p>"It is not usual, Mr. Ferrers, to allow an officer
to resign when he's facing serious charges."</p>

<p>"But I'll resign just the same, sir. Pardon
me, sir, but I don't care what you say, now.
Things have come to a pass where I've simply
got to strike back for myself, sooner than see
my family troubled by the idea of my being
tried."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if your resignation is not accepted, Mr.
Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be, won't it, if I say that I
simply won't bother to stay in the beastly old
Army any longer?"</p>

<p>"No; a resignation doesn't have to be accepted,
and the fact that you are under charges
will operate to prevent the consideration of your
resignation until after your trial."</p>

<p>Algy Ferrers looked mightily disturbed over
that information.</p>

<p>"Are you serious about wanting to resign and
getting out of the Army, Mr. Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; very much in earnest."</p>

<p>Colonel North thought for a few moments.
Then he replied:</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Ferrers. You are of no
service whatever in the Army, I am sorry to
say, though I doubt if you could possibly understand
why you are of no use here. If you write
your resignation before leaving this room, I will
see that the resignation is forwarded, and I will
then drop all idea of preferring charges against
you."</p>

<p>Colonel North made room at his own desk,
after providing the stationery. Algy wrote his
resignation as an officer of the Army, signing
it with a triumphant flourish.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to have this resignation, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Ferrers," declared Colonel North, speaking
more gently at last.</p>

<p>"You can't be any more glad than I am to
write it, sir," Algy replied, his face now beaming.
"I am glad to cut loose from it all. From
the very first day I've been coming more and
more to the conclusion, sir, that the Army is no
place for a gentleman!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>PLANNING FOR THE SOLDIERS' HUNT</h3>


<div class='cap'>"I'LL go away on the eleven o'clock train
to-morrow, sir," stated Algy, as he rose
to go. "I won't bother about the few
things in my room until I go to Denver and engage
a man. Then I'll send my man here to
pack up whatever of my belongings are worth
having."</div>

<p>"Do you really imagine you can leave the
post to-morrow, Mr. Ferrers?" demanded the
colonel, a good deal astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes; can't I?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ferrers, you are of the Army until your
resignation has been accepted in the usual
way."</p>

<p>"Haven't you accepted it, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"I have no authority to do so. Your resignation
will have to go to Washington through
the usual military channels, and can be accepted
only by the authority of the President."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be all right," declared Algy
promptly. "I'll get my friend, Benson-Bodge,
to attend to that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he can't do it for you, young
man. Mr. Ferrers, you will have to remain at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
this post, and perform all your duties, until
the acceptance of your resignation comes in due
form, and through the usual channels. And if
you absent yourself from post again, without
leave, I'll use the telegraph to make sure that
your resignation is refused and that you are
obliged to stand trial."</p>

<p>It took Mr. Ferrers until the next morning to
recover his good spirits.</p>

<p>Then, immediately after the first drill&mdash;which
he attended on time&mdash;Algy went over to the post
telegraph station, where he picked up a blank
and wrote this message to his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You'll be glad to know that I'll be with you
after a few days more. Have resigned from
this beastly Army."</p></div>

<p>Sergeant Noll Terry was in charge of the office.
He looked the message over gravely, then
said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, but I am afraid that I cannot
allow this message to go without the written
approval of the post commander."</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked Algy.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but you have referred to
the Army in slighting terms. I am certain that
Colonel North would censure me if I allowed
this message to go."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm an officer&mdash;yet&mdash;so what right have
you to refuse to send it, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be approved by Colonel
North, or his adjutant, before I can allow it to
be sent, sir," replied Noll firmly.</p>

<p>"Humph! But it's high time to get out of
the Army when a chap can't even write his own
telegrams!"</p>

<p>However, Ferrers thought it over for a few
moments. Then he wrote this new message:</p>

<p>"Expect me home, soon. Have resigned from
the Army."</p>

<p>"Is a chap allowed to send a message like
that?" Algy inquired plaintively.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Lieutenant," Noll replied, and
handed the message over to a soldier operator.</p>

<p>A glance at the clock in the room told Lieutenant
Ferrers that he had a little time to spare
before he was due at his next bit of duty. He
put in the time strolling about the post. When
he saw the brisk, trim-looking soldiers, and received
their salutes in passing, Algy began almost
to regret the Army that he had given up.
Then the remembrance of gay times in the set
where he had once been something of a favorite
consoled him, and he looked forward to being
where he did not have to answer to a colonel as
a boy does to a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, I think I could like the Army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
very well, if they weren't so beastly strict about
everything," murmured Algy to himself.</p>

<p>Finally a bugle blew, and Lieutenant Ferrers
hastened away to another duty, which was not
now so distasteful, since there was soon to be an
end of it all.</p>

<p>"I used to think being a soldier was all
parading," Algy muttered to himself. "I
didn't know that there was about six months
of never-ending drill behind each parade."</p>

<p>Just before the noon mess call Captain Cortland,
in passing, called out to Hal.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, it is getting so well on into the
fall of the year, now, that Major Silsbee has
suggested to me that some of the men of B
company would do well to hit the trail into the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Another practice hike, sir?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Sergeant. The enlisted men of
this post, to say nothing of the officers, would
appreciate some supplies of game in place of
the regular issues of beef and mutton. Major
Silsbee has suggested that I allow some of the
men of B company to form themselves into a
hunting party and go away on leave into the
mountains."</p>

<p>"That would be fine for the men who get
away, sir," agreed Hal, his eyes shining at the
thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"How would you like, Sergeant, to make up
such a party and head it?" continued Captain
Cortland.</p>

<p>"I head the hunting party? I would like it
immensely, sir, but for one objection. I am not
an experienced hunter."</p>

<p>"But you are a non-commissioned officer who
would be sure to preserve whatever discipline
may be needed on a hunting trip, and that is
the matter of greatest importance. As to experience
in hunting, there are some highly experienced
hunters in B company, and you could
include them in your party."</p>

<p>"How much discipline is needed, sir, with a
hunting party?"</p>

<p>"Not too much," replied Captain Cortland.
"A soldier's hunting party is something of a
picnic affair, and discipline is relaxed as much
as possible. You want just enough discipline
to keep order and make the men pull together.
For, on one of these hunting parties, recollect
that the men are actually expected to bag
enough game, and to bring it back with them."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Captain, and I shall be delighted
if I can persuade enough of the really
useful men to go with me. But I suppose you
know, sir, that there is still a good deal of suspicion
felt about me in barracks."</p>

<p>As Hal said this he flushed a bit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that old affair, Sergeant, of Private
Green and his missing money?" replied the captain.
"Sergeant, no suspicion ever justly directed
itself against you, and you must deny,
even to yourself, that any of the suspicion still
lingers in the minds of any of the men."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"But you haven't answered me as to whether
you will head the hunting party."</p>

<p>"I shall do it gladly and eagerly, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good; then pick out about fourteen
men to go with you, and make sure that they
all wish to go, as no soldier is compelled to go
on a hunting trip against his own wishes. It
will take you about two days to reach the hunting
grounds, Sergeant, and about two days more
to get back. So you shall have fourteen days'
leave, which will give you about ten days of
actual hunting."</p>

<p>"I thank you again, sir."</p>

<p>"Go and find your men."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. May I include Sergeant
Terry?"</p>

<p>"If he can arrange for relief at the telegraph
station."</p>

<p>In his spare time during the rest of the day
Sergeant Hal Overton was extremely happy. He
was busy interviewing soldiers, and in finding
out who were the most experienced hunters, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
there was big game to be had up in the mountains.</p>

<p>Noll was invited first of all. Terry succeeded
in arranging for relief from telegraph duties,
so that he could go.</p>

<p>Corporal Hyman proved to be one of the
skilled hunters, and he at once agreed, besides
suggesting others who should be invited.</p>

<p>"It's a great picnic, Kid Sergeant; you don't
know what bully fun it is until you get there,"
Hyman assured Hal.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ferrers dropped in at the officers'
club well ahead of the dinner hour that evening.</p>

<p>"Yes, fellows," he drawled, "I'm going back
to life and civilization. No more of this boarding
school and chain-gang life for me."</p>

<p>The other officers present laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"Yet, just as sure as you're alive, Ferrers,
the day will come, and before long, when you'll
wish yourself back once more among the regulars'
uniforms."</p>

<p>"Maybe," sniffed Algy doubtfully.</p>

<p>An orderly appeared in the doorway, yellow
envelope in hand.</p>

<p>"Telegram for Lieutenant Ferrers," he announced.</p>

<p>"Right here, my man. Thank you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Algy tore open the envelope, after apologizing,
and glanced at the bottom of the message.</p>

<p>"It's from the guv'nor," he announced. "I
expect he's getting ready to kill the fatted calf
against my arrival home."</p>

<p>Then Algy fell to reading the message. As
he started his brows puckered. Once he gasped.
Then, at the end, he burst forth:</p>

<p>"My, but the guv'nor seems almost annoyed,"
cried Algy, his face reddening.</p>

<p>"Anything serious?" inquired Holmes politely.</p>

<p>"Read it aloud to the rest, old chap," begged
Algy, passing the telegram to Lieutenant
Holmes. This was the message that the latter
thereupon read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You blithering young idiot! I worked like
blazes to get you into the Army, in order to
give you one last chance to grab at a little manhood.
I've set the government machinery going
at Washington, and your resignation won't
be accepted. Within a day or two you'll receive
orders to report at the Infantry School at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. There you'll have
to work sixteen hours out of every twenty-four,
but it will make a man of you if anything can,
and you'll learn all about becoming a real infantry
officer. Don't send me any more news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
about resigning. If you quit the Army, or are
kicked out of it, I'll separate you forever from
every cent of my money.</p>

<div class='sig'>"(Signed) Donald Ferrers."<br />
</div></div>

<p>There was silence in the club parlor, until it
was broken by Algy, who wailed plaintively:</p>

<p>"That's the guv'nor. That's the guv'nor
every time. Says he'd separate me from every
cent of his money. And he'd do it, too! Fellows,
I'm afraid I've simply got to like the
Army."</p>

<p>"That's your trump card, now, Algy," observed
Jerrold, of A company.</p>

<p>"Some class about your father, Ferrers, isn't
there?" asked Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a fine old fellow," replied Algy
loyally. "But he has a confoundedly abrupt
way about him sometimes. You see, he didn't&mdash;er&mdash;start
life exactly as a gentleman. He
had to work hard most of his life to get what
money he has, and I suppose&mdash;well, I guess his
hard work has made him pig-headed to some
extent."</p>

<p>Now that he knew that he would have to stay
in the Army, young Ferrers found himself hating
it worse than ever.</p>

<p>Nor did the information that his comrades
offered him console him any. He was assured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that there would be no doubt about his learning
all of his military duties at Fort Leavenworth&mdash;if
he lived to get through the ordeal.</p>

<p>In the Army there is an officers' school for
every branch of the service. Officers attend as
"student officers"; the course is severe, but the
officer seldom fails to learn whatever he goes
to such a school to learn.</p>

<p>Two days later there were two officers leaving
the post.</p>

<p>Algy went down to the station to take up his
journey to the new station in Kansas. Despite
his seeming inability to learn to be a soldier,
Ferrers had made himself well enough liked
personally, so many of the officers accompanied
him as far as the Clowdry station.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott was going with the hunting
party. He had succeeded in procuring
leave for hunting, and in getting himself invited
to go along with Sergeant Hal Overton's party.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>HAL'S GUN MAKES THE REST CURIOUS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"OH, my, but that smells good!"</div>

<p>The words came in a sort of ecstasy
from the lips of Sergeant Noll Terry,
as, gun in hand, he tramped into camp with
Corporal Hyman and three others.</p>

<p>"Bear meat," said Slosson briefly. "Sergeant
Overton and Lieutenant Prescott brought
it in just before noon with their compliments."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere out in the world," replied Private
Kelly, nodding at the mountain tops beyond.
"They went out to see how much more
they could get."</p>

<p>Slosson had mentioned the sergeant before
the lieutenant, but that was not an unpardonable
breach of etiquette, out here in the wilds.</p>

<p>More especially was it proper because Sergeant
Hal, and not the handsome, fine, young
West Pointer, commanded this camp and detachment.</p>

<p>"Where are your mates, Sarge?" inquired
Slosson.</p>

<p>"Oh, I left my crowd," smiled Noll. "They
won't be in for an hour yet, in all probability."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get anything, any of you?" queried Kelly.</p>

<p>"Not a thing, up to the time I quit," sighed
Noll.</p>

<p>"Humph! We've all got to get a brace on
us," muttered Slosson. "This is our third day
in camp, and what have we killed so far? Just
enough meat to satisfy the appetites we've developed
up here in the hills!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Hal Overton's hunting detachment
of the Thirty-fourth was now encamped up in
the highest points, almost, of all the Colorado
Rockies.</p>

<p>Entraining, the party had gone some sixty
miles over the rails. At the station where the
men detrained two heavy Army wagons had
been awaiting them, these wagons having been
sent on two days ahead.</p>

<p>On the first day after leaving the railway the
hunting detachment had marched some eighteen
miles; on the second day fifteen miles had been
covered, and now camp was pitched more than
ninety miles from Fort Clowdry.</p>

<p>The little village of wall tents stood some fifty
feet away from where Privates Slosson and
Kelly were now busy getting the evening meal.</p>

<p>There was still about an hour of daylight left.
It was not expected that many of the hunters
would be in much before the sun went down
behind the western tops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's chilly to-night," announced Sergeant
Terry, standing back and watching the two soldiers
at work.</p>

<p>"It's hot," grumbled Slosson, piling on more
wood and stirring one of the open cook fires.</p>

<p>"All a matter of where you happen to be
standing," laughed Noll, diving into the tent
that he and Hal occupied. When Sergeant Terry
came out again he had on his olive tan overcoat.</p>

<p>Three days of incessant hunting had been indulged
in. "Enjoyed" would have been the
word, only that so far the men of the detachment
had not struck very heavy luck with the
game.</p>

<p>It was not Hal's fault. He, confessedly, was
not an experienced hunter in the Rockies. Corporal
Hyman was an old hand at the hunt, and
there were other soldiers in the detachment who
could find the wild game when there was any
to be found. Up to date, however, the game had
been scarce. A few mountain antelope and some
smaller animals&mdash;but these the hungry hunters
had eaten as fast as they bagged.</p>

<p>The party consisted of Sergeants Overton and
Terry, Corporals Hyman and Cotter, twelve privates
and Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>Mr. Prescott was not a detailed member of
the detachment. He had secured leave from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the post and had asked to be accepted as a guest.
For this reason the young West Pointer did
not attempt to command in camp. Each morning
the officer accompanied which ever party of
hunters he chose.</p>

<p>Every day two of the soldiers were left behind
for the double duty of watching the camp and
of cooking the morning and evening meals. For
the noon meal, or in place thereof, the hunters
carried such dry food as they could stow away
in their pockets.</p>

<p>"How big was the bear before you cut him
up?" asked Noll, standing about and watching
the cooks.</p>

<p>"About a hundred and thirty pounds, I
guess," replied Slosson.</p>

<p>"How far away from here did they shoot
him?"</p>

<p>"Over a mile."</p>

<p>"Hm! Hal must have had a long, heavy
pack."</p>

<p>"The lieutenant was carrying the carcass when
they reached camp," retorted Private Kelly.
"The lieutenant did his full share in packing
the meat in. That lieutenant ain't a dude."</p>

<p>"I know he isn't," Noll nodded quietly.
"Still I didn't suppose Hal would feel like letting
an officer make a pack animal of himself."</p>

<p>"Your bunkie ain't no dude, either, Sarge,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
continued Kelly. "Him and the lieutenant are
two men of pretty near the same color."</p>

<p>"White isn't a color, anyway," laughed Noll.</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't," assented Private Kelly.</p>

<p>Noll turned to look at the descending sun.</p>

<p>"My, I don't believe I've ever been as hungry
as I am now," complained Noll.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, Sarge, until the rest of the
crowd comes in," grinned Slosson.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy enough for you fellows to
say," grunted Noll. "You two have been in
camp all day, and you had a big, filling, hot meal
at noon. All I had at noon was a hard tack
and a half."</p>

<p>"You could have carried more," insisted
Slosson.</p>

<p>"I had more, but I didn't find water anywhere
and hard tack is abominably dry stuff to get
down without help."</p>

<p>"Go over to the bucket and help yourself
to water now, Sarge," suggested Private Kelly
teasingly.</p>

<p>"I think I will," agreed Noll, turning.</p>

<p>"Take a lot of it," urged Slosson. "Water,
when you get enough of it, is mighty filling."</p>

<p>"I'll brain you, if you go on making fun
of a hungry man," warned Sergeant Noll Terry,
as he reached for the dipper hanging on a nail
driven into a tree trunk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would look like losing your temper,"
retorted Kelly. "Now, what are you mad with
us for, Sarge? Haven't we been in camp all
day, working like Chinamen just so you fellows
can have something to eat when you get back
from the day's stroll?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm back," argued Noll.</p>

<p>"And you'll eat, Sarge, when the rest eat."</p>

<p>"What's in that oven?" queried Noll, pausing
before an Army cookstove.</p>

<p>"Mince pie," remarked Kelly quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you fiend!" growled Sergeant Noll. "To
torment a hungry man with lies like that!"</p>

<p>"Lies, eh?" roared the soldier. "A Kelly to
stand by and have a sergeant boy tell him his
mother raised a family of liars. Ye sassenach,
take one peep&mdash;and then may yer stomach cave
in before the meal's laid!"</p>

<p>Kelly cautiously opened the oven door for a
brief moment, affording Noll an instant's
glimpse of three browning pies.</p>

<p>"And there's six more of them hid here,"
added Kelly tantalizingly.</p>

<p>"And you have the cruel nerve to tell that
to a man dying of starvation?" demanded Sergeant
Noll with heat. "Kelly, it takes me four
seconds to get my overcoat off, and only two
seconds to get off the blouse underneath!"</p>

<p>"At that rate, how long would it take you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to undress altogether?" demanded Kelly indifferently.
"For the last five minutes I've had
my eyes on ye. I've been thinking how fine ye'd
look in grave clothes."</p>

<p>"I don't have to take off many clothes, Kelly,
to be down to fighting trim enough to thrash
you!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take advantage of ye," protested
Kelly generously. "Sure it would be no victory
for a Kelly to whip a dying man."</p>

<p>"What's the fight about, men?" inquired a
jolly voice.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott had entered camp unnoticed.
Instantly the soldiers straightened up,
raising their hands to their caps in salute. Mr.
Prescott returned their salutes. On first meeting
the officer in the morning the men saluted
him, then again when he returned from the day's
hunt. For the rest of the time, at Lieutenant
Prescott's own request, they treated him like
one of themselves.</p>

<p>"This sassenach is threatening to murder me,
Lieutenant," complained Kelly, "just because I
showed him a pie and wouldn't let him eat it
on the spot."</p>

<p>"That would be enough to make me commit
murder, too, if I weren't a guest here," replied
the lieutenant gravely, as he reached down the
dipper and helped himself to a drink from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
water bucket. "How many pies have you
there?"</p>

<p>"Nine, sir, when the three in the oven come
out."</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"Mince."</p>

<p>"Um-um-um!" quoth the officer.</p>

<p>"The sun's going so low now, Kelly, that
I'm minded to let you live another day," broke
in Sergeant Noll.</p>

<p>"Aw, that's just because there's company
present," growled Kelly, with a side glance at
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Supper ready?" hailed a distant voice.</p>

<p>"Will be, when you come in and fetch the
wood to cook with," Slosson hailed back through
his hands.</p>

<p>A growl of desperation came from the party
headed by Corporal Hyman. Then in they
tramped, but they carried only their rifles.</p>

<p>"What have ye been doing the long day?"
demanded Kelly, with a keen look at the party.</p>

<p>"Getting up an appetite for supper," retorted
Corporal Hyman.</p>

<p>"But the game?"</p>

<p>"'Twas so heavy we gave up carrying it,"
grinned Corporal Hyman.</p>

<p>"The boys back in barracks have had their
mouths watering for game for days," grunted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Slosson. "How'll we ever break the news to
'em?"</p>

<p>The soldiers shook their heads blankly.</p>

<p>"Want a suggestion as to the gentlest way
of breaking the news back home, Slosson?" inquired
Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"We'd surely be grateful for it, sir," answered
Slosson.</p>

<p>"Then we'll coax Sergeant Overton to wire
back requesting full rations for seventeen days
for seventeen men."</p>

<p>"It'd be a bad trick, sir."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The post commissary sergeant would be that
mad he'd poison the grub, sir, before shipping
it."</p>

<p>"I believe he would," agreed Mr. Prescott
thoughtfully. "For the men back in barracks
are looking for at least four tons of game food."</p>

<p>Bang! Bang!</p>

<p>"Hello! What's that?" cried Noll, starting
up and listening.</p>

<p>"Queer question for a soldier to be askin',"
mocked Private Kelly.</p>

<p>Bang-bang-bang!</p>

<p>"Wirra, but that feller can't stop to take
breath between his shooting," remarked Private
Kelly.</p>

<p>"Those shots," declared Lieutenant Prescott,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
"sound out in the direction where I left Sergeant
Overton."</p>

<p>"He's struck something," declared Noll gleefully.</p>

<p>"Some of us had better go out there," hinted
Lieutenant Prescott, rising from the campstool
that he had brought out from his tent. "Either
the sergeant is in trouble, or else he's bagging
a wagonload of game."</p>

<p>"Bang-bang!" sounded the distant rifle.</p>

<p>"He's moving, anyway, whoever he is," declared
Sergeant Noll.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!"</p>

<p>"'Lo yerselves!" yelled back Kelly.</p>

<p>Another group of men came, and right after
them the remainder of the hunters save one.</p>

<p>Bang-bang!</p>

<p>"Now we know it's Sergeant Overton out
there," announced Lieutenant Prescott. Then
he turned to Noll.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Terry, you're in charge. What are
you going to do about it?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>BIG GAME AND A NIGHT IN CAMP</h3>


<div class='cap'>"IT'S a bad time to follow through the
woods," remarked Corporal Cotter.
"There goes the sun behind the tops."</div>

<p>"It'll be dark within five or six minutes
more," said Noll. "If Hal Overton is running
about in the woods, I think the best thing to
do will be to run two lanterns up to the tree top,
so that Overton can locate the camp. Then, if
he's in any further difficulty, he'll fire the rifle
signal. What do you think, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Mr. Prescott promptly.
"You're in temporary command here, Sergeant
Terry."</p>

<p>"Run up the camp lights, Johnson," Noll directed.</p>

<p>These lights, a red and a green one, were
quickly run up on halyards to almost the top of
a tall fir tree.</p>

<p>It was quickly dark, but camp now waited
to learn the meaning of so many shots.</p>

<p>"Hey, there's Dinkelspiel's Comet let loose
in the sky!" announced Private Johnson.</p>

<p>"Wrong! It's Overton waving a torch from a
tree top," returned Noll, studying the flame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
sweeps of the distant torch that waved. "Johnson
get hold of the halyards and raise and lower
the lanterns two or three times to let Sergeant
Overton know that we see his signal."</p>

<p>The distant signalman now began waving his
torch from right to left, following the regular
code.</p>

<p>"Send&mdash;here&mdash;all&mdash;men&mdash;can&mdash;spare," read
Sergeant Terry, following the torch's movements
with his eyes. "Will&mdash;signal&mdash;time&mdash;to&mdash;time&mdash;till&mdash;men&mdash;arrive.
Overton."</p>

<p>"He must be in trouble," cried Hyman.</p>

<p>"No; he's struck game," retorted Noll.
"Johnson, raise and lower the lanterns three
times to show Sergeant Overton that his signal
has been read. Now, then, we'll all get out
there on a hike&mdash;a fast hike. But we'll have
to leave some one here who can read further
signals. Lieutenant, do you mind, sir, watching
further signals?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," agreed young Mr. Prescott,
laughing, "if you feel that I'll be of no use
on the hike. But if you asked me what I'd like,
I'd rather go with you."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Corporal Hyman, you will
remain here and watch for further signals.
Kelly and Slosson, of course, will stay by the
supper. The rest&mdash;forward!"</p>

<p>"Guns, Sergeant?" called one of the men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two of you bring rifles, in case of trouble.
The rest had better be unencumbered. Forward."</p>

<p>Having located his bunkie's direction, Noll
had little difficulty in finding the way. Most of
the time they were within sight of the torch that
moved from time to time.</p>

<p>"Hel-lo, bun-kie!" hailed Noll when the party
was within an eighth of a mile of the tree.</p>

<p>"Hello! Glad you're here."</p>

<p>From the subsequent movements of the torch
the approaching party knew that Overton was
going down the tree. Then they saw him coming
over the ground.</p>

<p>"What's up?" hailed Noll.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I've just come down," retorted
Sergeant Hal.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Killing game," replied Sergeant Overton,
as he headed toward them.</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"All you'll want to lug back," chuckled Sergeant
Hal gleefully. "Come on, now, and I'll
show you. You see," Sergeant Hal continued,
as the party joined him, "I got a sight at a
fine antelope buck to windward and only four
hundred yards away. I brought him down the
first shot."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Sarge!" teased Private
Johnson.</p>

<p>"I fired two shots, but the first toppled him,"
insisted Hal. "Come, look here."</p>

<p>Hal Overton halted under the trees, pointing
with his torch.</p>

<p>It was certainly a fine, sleek, heavy buck to
which Hal pointed.</p>

<p>"But you didn't need all of us to carry it in,
did you?" demanded one of the men.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," laughed Hal happily. "Swing
on to the buck, a couple of you, and come along.
I'll tell you the rest. Just after I fired the second
shot I heard a growl close to me. Less
than a hundred yards away I heard a sound of
paws moving toward me. Then I saw him.
There he is."</p>

<p>Sergeant Overton's torch now lit up the carcass
of a dead brown bear, one of the biggest
that any of them had ever seen.</p>

<p>"And right behind him," went on Hal, "was
Mrs. Bruin. I can tell you, my nerve was beginning
to ooze. But I fired&mdash;and here's the
lady bear."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hal led his soldier friends to the
second bear carcass.</p>

<p>"But it wasn't more than a second or two
later," laughed Hal, though some of the soldiers
now noticed the quiver in his voice, "that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
began to think some one had locked me in with
a menagerie and turned the key loose. Just
beyond were a he-bear and two more females,
and they were plainly some mad and headed
toward me."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Lieutenant Prescott.
"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Shook with the buck fever," admitted the
boyish sergeant, with a laugh. "I'm not joking,
either. I didn't expect to get back to camp
alive, for it was growing dark in here under
the trees, and I knew I couldn't depend on my
shooting. I'm almost afraid I closed my eyes
as I fired and kept firing. But, anyway&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hal stopped, holding his torch so as to show
the carcass of another male bear. Not many
yards away lay two females.</p>

<p>"An antelope and five bears!" gasped Lieutenant
Prescott. "Sergeant Overton, you've
qualified for the sharpshooter class in two minutes!"</p>

<p>"I don't claim any credit for the last three
bears," insisted Hal. "I simply don't know
how I hit 'em. It wasn't marksmanship, anyway."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" spoke Prescott almost sharply.
"It was clever shooting and uncommonly brave
work."</p>

<p>"Brave, sir?" retorted Hal, laughingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
"Lieutenant, do you note how my teeth are still
chattering? I'm shaking all over, still, for that
matter."</p>

<p>"Talk until morning light comes, and you
can't throw any discredit either on your shooting
or your nerve, Sergeant Overton. If you
won't take a young officer's word for it," answered
Mr. Prescott, "then ask any of the old,
buck doughboys in this outfit."</p>

<p>"It's a job an old hunter'd brag about,"
glowed one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Forgetting, for the time, their hunger, the
men wandered from one carcass to another, examining
them to see where the hits had been
made.</p>

<p>"If you men are not going to get together
soon, to pick up these animals, I'll have to tote
'em all myself," Prescott reminded them.
"Terry, will you swing on under this bear with
me?"</p>

<p>The two managed to raise it.</p>

<p>"Here, Lieutenant, that's not for you to do,"
remonstrated Sergeant Overton. "Let me take
hold of your end."</p>

<p>"I'm not a weakling, thank you," retorted
Mr. Prescott. "I'll do my share, and I recommend
you to proclaim that any man who doesn't
do his share doesn't eat to-night. But as for
you, Sergeant Overton, I shall have a bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
opinion of this outfit if they let you carry anything
more than your rifle back to camp this
night."</p>

<p>And that motion was carried unanimously.
Sergeant Hal was forced to go ahead as guide,
while the others, the lieutenant included,
buckled manfully to their burdens.</p>

<p>Not infrequently they had to halt and rest,
for the carcasses were fearfully heavy, even for
men as toughened as regulars.</p>

<p>Yet, finally, they did manage to get Hal's
prizes back to camp.</p>

<p>"Another day or two like this, and we needn't
be ashamed to face the men back at Clowdry,"
observed Lieutenant Prescott complacently.
"Six bears and a buck antelope in one day is
no fool work, even if one man did do it all."</p>

<p>"But you killed the bear this morning, sir,"
urged Sergeant Hal.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant; after you had fired the first
shot and had crippled the beast so that it
couldn't get away from me."</p>

<p>Not even to gloat over the big haul of game,
however, could the men wait any longer for
their long-deferred evening meal.</p>

<p>There was a general washup, after which the
entire party went to table.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott permitted one concession
to his rank. He sat at table with the enlisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
men, but he had one end of the board all to himself.</p>

<p>Two ruddy campfires now shed their glow
over the table. It was a rough scene, but one
full of the sheer joy of outdoor, manly life.</p>

<p>"I hope, Kelly, that the long wait hasn't encouraged
to-night's bear meat to dry up in the
pans," remarked the lieutenant pleasantly.</p>

<p>"No fear o' that, sir," replied the soldier
cook. "Instead, the meat had simmered so long
in its own juices that a thin pewter fork would
pick it to pieces."</p>

<p>"How much meat is there?" asked Private
Johnson, whereat all the men laughed as happily
as schoolboys on a picnic.</p>

<p>"Never ye fear, glutton," retorted Kelly.
"There's more meat than any seventeen giants
in the fairy tales could ever eat at one sitting."</p>

<p>And then on it came&mdash;great hunks of roast
bear meat, flanked with browned potatoes and
gravy; flaky biscuits, huge pats of butter, bowls
heaped with canned vegetables. Pots of steaming
coffee passed up and down the table.</p>

<p>Hunters in the wilds get back close to nature,
and have the appetites of savages. These men
around the camp table ate, every man of them,
twice as much as he could have eaten back at
company mess at Fort Clowdry.</p>

<p>Then, to top it all, came more coffee and mince<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
pie in abundance. Nor did these hardy hunters,
after climbing the mountain trails all day, fear
the nightmare. Their stomachs were fitted to
digest anything edible!</p>

<p>It was over at last, and pipes came out here
and there, though not all of the soldiers smoked.</p>

<p>Hal Overton was one of those who did not
smoke. He had brought out his rubber poncho
and a blanket, and had placed these on the frosty
ground at some distance from one of the campfires.</p>

<p>"You are looking rather thoughtful, Sergeant,"
observed Lieutenant Prescott, strolling
over to Overton. "I hope I am not interrupting
any train of thought."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"May I sit down beside you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hal moved over, making plenty of
room on his blanket. Officer and non-com.
stretched themselves out comfortably, each resting
on one elbow.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Sergeant," continued Mr.
Prescott, "you were thinking of something very
particular when I came along."</p>

<p>"I was just thinking, sir, how jolly this life
is, and for that matter, how jolly everything
connected with the Army is. I was wondering
why so many young fellows let their earlier manhood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
slip by without finding out what an ideal
place the Army is."</p>

<p>"But what is especially jolly just now, Sergeant,"
replied the lieutenant, "is the hunting.
Now, men don't have to enter the Army in order
to have all the hunting they want."</p>

<p>"But we're drawing our pay while here," returned
Overton. "And we are having our expenses
paid, too. The man in civil life doesn't
get that. If he hunts, he must do it at his own
expense. Then there's another point, sir. In
the case of the average hunting party of men
from civil life it must be hard to find a lot of
really good fellows, who'll keep their good nature
all through the hardships of camping. For
instance, where, in civil life, could you get together
seventeen fellows, all of them as fine fellows
and as agreeable as we have here? But
I beg the lieutenant's pardon. I didn't intend
to include him as one of the crowd, for the rest
are all enlisted men."</p>

<p>"I want to be considered one of the crowd,"
replied the young officer simply.</p>

<p>"But you're not an enlisted man, sir."</p>

<p>"No; but I've cast my lot with the Army
for life, and so, I trust, have most of you enlisted
men. Therefore we all belong together,
though not all can be officers. For that matter,
I imagine there are a good many men in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ranks of our battalion who wouldn't care to be
officers. Many soldiers are of a happy-go-lucky
type, and wouldn't care to burden themselves
with an officer's responsibilities. Yet I
certainly want to be, as far as good discipline
will permit, one of the crowd along with all
good, staunch and loyal soldiers, whatever their
grades of rank may be."</p>

<p>This was seeing the commissioned officer of
Uncle Sam's Army in a somewhat different
light, even to one as keen and observing as Hal
Overton.</p>

<p>In garrison life it is very seldom that the enlisted
man gets a real glimpse of the "man
side" of the officer. The requirements of military
discipline are such that officers and enlisted
men do not often mingle on any terms of equality.
This fact, as far as the American Army
goes, is based on the military experience of ages
that, when officers and men mingle on terms of
too much equality, discipline suffers sadly. It
is this intimacy of officers and men that keeps
many National Guard organizations from reaching
greater efficiency.</p>

<p>Men have served through a whole term of enlistment
in the regular Army without realizing
how friendly a really good and capable officer
always feels toward the really good enlisted men
under his command. The captain of a company,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
is, in effect, the father of his company, and
his time must be spent largely in looking after
the actual welfare and happiness of his men.
In this work the captain's lieutenants are his
assistants.</p>

<p>Soon the night grew much colder in this high
altitude. Now the wood was heaped on one
fire, and around this blazing pile soldiers sat
or stretched themselves on blankets and ponchos.
It is at such a time that the soldier's
yarns crop up. Story after story of the military
life was told. All in good time Lieutenant
Prescott contributed his share, from anecdotes
of the old days at West Point.</p>

<p>Then it became so late that Sergeant Hal announced
that Johnson and Dietz would have
the camp detail for the day following. This
meant, also, that Johnson and Dietz would therefore
divide between them the duty of watching
over the camp through the night.</p>

<p>It was Johnson who took the first trick of the
watch, while the others turned in in their tents.</p>

<p>Holding his rifle across his knees, mainly as
a matter of form, Johnson sat down by the campfire,
while his drowsy comrades turned in in
their tents and slept the sleep of the strong in
that clear, crisp Colorado air.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>HOLDING UP A CAMP GUARD</h3>


<div class='cap'>HALF an hour before daylight was due
everyone in the camp was stirring.</div>

<p>The two new cooks for the day had
their work cut out for them. Other soldiers
busied themselves with hauling wood and water.</p>

<p>Then, too, the four horses belonging to the
transport wagons had to be curried, watered
and fed.</p>

<p>By the time these first duties were out of the
way broad daylight had come and breakfast
was ready.</p>

<p>The meal over "police," or cleaning up, was
performed as carefully as in barracks.</p>

<p>The hunters were now ready to set out, for,
in the meantime, the antelope and bears killed
the afternoon before had been skinned and the
meat hung up in the dry, cool air.</p>

<p>"Anybody in this outfit been wearing moccasins?"
queried Corporal Hyman, strolling
back into camp.</p>

<p>No one admitted it.</p>

<p>"Then we've been having visitors in the
night," continued Hyman. "No less than four
of them, either, for the prints are right under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that tree over there, and they lead down to the
trail."</p>

<p>"Moccasins? Indians, then?" thrilled Private
William Green, who was one of the hunting
party.</p>

<p>"Sorry to spoil your dream of glory in an
Indian fight, Green," laughed the lieutenant,
"but the last Indian in these parts died years
ago."</p>

<p>"But what can the moccasins mean?" pondered
Sergeant Hal aloud. "If there have
been visitors about, and honest ones, they would
naturally let themselves be announced. Dietz,
you had the last trick of watch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Did you see or hear any prowlers?"</p>

<p>"Nary one, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Corporal Hyman, take me over to the moccasin
prints. Lieutenant, do you mind taking
a look at them, too, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Prescott stepped over in the wake of Hyman
and Overton.</p>

<p>"There are the prints," declared the corporal,
pointing. "On account of the hard ground
they're not very distinct, but there were four
of the fellows."</p>

<p>"More likely five," supplemented Lieutenant
Prescott, pointing to still another set of footmarks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here are other prints over here," called Sergeant
Overton. "Aren't these still a different
set?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed both the lieutenant and Corporal
Hyman.</p>

<p>"Then there were at least six men prowling
about here while we slept in the night," concluded
Hal.</p>

<p>"And here is one of the trails," called the
lieutenant, "leading toward camp."</p>

<p>"Suppose we follow the trail?" suggested the
young sergeant.</p>

<p>They did so, halting at the end of the trail.</p>

<p>"From here I can see where the stool of the
guard rested near the fire," continued Overton.
"From that it would seem fair to conclude that
one of the prowlers got this far, found our guard
awake, and then retired."</p>

<p>"It would be interesting to know who our
visitors were," nodded Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"I've changed my mind about going hunting
to-day," went on Sergeant Hal. "While the
rest of you are out after game I am going to
remain right here."</p>

<p>"The camp is guarded by two reliable men,"
remarked Mr. Prescott.</p>

<p>"True enough, sir, but they're not real
guards, for both will have their hands full with
camp housework," objected the boyish sergeant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
"They can't do real guard duty, or else we'd
all have to turn to get the evening meal in a
rush. So I've decided to remain behind to-day."</p>

<p>"And, on the whole, I think you're wise to
do it, Sergeant," approved the lieutenant.</p>

<p>So, while the main party hied itself away soon
after, Hal Overton remained behind with the
two camp duty men.</p>

<p>Having a couple of good books in his tent,
Sergeant Hal donned his olive tan Army overcoat,
spread a poncho and a pair of blankets
on the ground and lay down to read.</p>

<p>But his rifle and ammunition belt rested beside
him.</p>

<p>The morning passed without any event, other
than two or three times Sergeant Overton
paused long enough in his reading to do some
brief scouting past the camp.</p>

<p>Nothing came of it, however. At noon Hal
ate with Dietz and Johnson.</p>

<p>"The chuck is better back in camp," laughed
the young sergeant. "But I've heard a gun
half a dozen times this morning, and each time
I've been curious to know how the hunting luck
is running."</p>

<p>"Nobody will beat the haul you made yesterday,
Sarge," offered Private Dietz.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd like to see several of the fellows beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it," rejoined Overton. "I certainly hope to see
both wagons go back loaded to the top with
game. I don't want to have the only military
command I ever enjoyed being the head of go
back stumped."</p>

<p>"We're not stumped, with five bear carcasses,"
hinted Private Johnson.</p>

<p>"Those carcasses might afford two meat
meals to the garrison," speculated Sergeant
Overton. "But what we want to do is to take
back so much game flesh that no man in Fort
Clowdry will want to hear game meat mentioned
again before next spring."</p>

<p>"Huh! By that time the old Thirty-fourth
will probably be in the Philippines," retorted
Dietz, forking eight ounces more of wood-broiled
bear steak to his tin plate.</p>

<p>"I wonder!" cried Hal, his eyes blazing with
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Crazy to get out to the islands, Sarge?"</p>

<p>"Humph! I put in three years there with
the Thirty-fourth," grunted Dietz. "I'll never
kick at a transfer to another regiment whenever
the regiment I'm in gets the islands
route."</p>

<p>"What have you against the Philippines?"
Hal wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Well, Sarge, don't you enjoy this cool, crisp,
bracing air up here in the hills?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly. Who wouldn't? This air is
bracing&mdash;life-giving."</p>

<p>"Nothing like it in the Philippines," answered
Dietz. "It's hot there&mdash;hot, you understand."</p>

<p>"Yet I've been told that a soldier always
needs his blankets there at night," objected
Hal.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you have to sleep outdoors, then you
need your full uniform on, including shoes and
leggings, and you wrap yourself up tight in your
blanket. But that isn't to keep warm; it's to
keep the mosquitoes from eating you alive. So,
after you get done up in your blanket, you
put a collapsible mosquito net over your head
to protect your face and neck. Then there's
a trick you have to learn of wrapping your
hands in under your blanket in such a way that
the skeeters can't follow inside. After you've
been in the islands a few weeks you learn how
to do yourself up so that the skeeters can't get
at your flesh."</p>

<p>"Then that ought to be all right," smiled
Hal hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yes; but you never heard a Filipino skeeter
holler when he's mad. When they find they
can't get at you then about four thousand settle
on your net and blanket and sing all night.
You've got to be fagged out before you can
sleep over the racket those little pests make."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess the whole trick can be learned,"
predicted Overton.</p>

<p>"The night trick can be learned after a
while," agreed Dietz. "But, in the daytime,
there's nothing that can be done to protect you.
You simply have to suffer. Then the hot days!
Why, Sarge, I've marched north up the tracks
of the Manila &amp; Dagupan railroad, carrying
fifty pounds of weight, on days when the sun
sure beat down on us at the rate of a hundred
and forty degrees Fahrenheit."</p>

<p>"Yet you're alive, now," observed Overton.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; just as it happens."</p>

<p>"But surely there's some marching in the
shade, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; sometimes you spend the whole
day, everyday for a fortnight, hiking through
the dense jungles after a gang of bolomen or
Moros or ladrones. Shade enough there in the
jungle, but it has a Turkish bath beaten to a
plum finish. You drip, drip, drip with perspiration,
until you'd give a week's pay to be out
in the sun for ten minutes with a chance to get
dried off."</p>

<p>"I'm going to like it, just the same," retorted
Hal. "I know I am. And, if the natives put
up any real trouble for us, then we'll see some
actual service. That's what a very young soldier
always aches for, you know, Dietz."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and it's sure fun fighting those brown-skinned
little Filipino goo-goos," grunted the
older soldier. "First they fire on you, and then
you and your comrades lie down and fire back.
After you've had a few men hit the order comes
to charge. Then you all rise and rush forward,
cheering like the Fourth of July. You have to
go through some tall grass on the way, and,
first thing you know, a parcel of hidden bolo
men jump up right in front of you. They use
their bolos&mdash;heavy knives&mdash;to slit you open at
the belt line. Ugh! I'd sooner fight five men
with guns than step on one of those bolo men in
the jungle!"</p>

<p>"Just the same," voiced the young sergeant,
"the sooner the Thirty-fourth is ordered to the
island the better I'll like it. I'm wild to see
some of the high foreign spots."</p>

<p>"Wish I could give you all the chances that
are coming to me in my service in the Army,"
grunted Private Dietz, as he rose from the table.</p>

<p>The afternoon was one of harder work for
the two camp duty men. Hal tried to read
again, but found his thoughts too frequently
wandering to the Philippines.</p>

<p>The afternoon waxed late, at last, though
still there was no sign of the hunters. Once in
a while a gun had been heard at some distance,
and that was all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>All the time Sergeant Hal had trailed his rifle
about camp with him. Now, tiring of reading,
he went to his tent, standing his rifle against
the front tent pole.</p>

<p>Hearing a swift step the young sergeant
reached the tent flap in time to see a roughly-dressed,
moccasined white man running away
with Hal's Army rifle.</p>

<p>Then, in the same instant, he heard a voice
call:</p>

<p>"Throw your hands up there, man!"</p>

<p>"Holding me up with my own gun, are you?"
raged Private Dietz.</p>

<p>"Yes; and we've got the other chap's lead-piece,
too. Up with your hands, both of you."</p>

<p>Hal dropped back behind the flap of his tent,
peering out through a little crack in the canvas.</p>

<p>There were now seven men outside, all strangers,
all rough-looking and all moccasined.</p>

<p>Between them they had the three rifles belonging
in camp that day.</p>

<p>"Bring out that other fellow, the kid sergeant,"
commanded the same voice, after Dietz
and Johnson, hopelessly surprised, had hoisted
their hands skyward.</p>

<p>"Humph!" growled Sergeant Hal, his eyes
snapping. "I don't like the idea of surrendering
the camp that I command!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>WHEN THE LAST CARTRIDGE WAS GONE</h3>


<div class='cap'>WHATEVER was to be done would have
to be done in a very few seconds.</div>

<p>For one of the rifle-armed strangers
had started briskly for the tent that concealed
the boyish sergeant.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens, he isn't going to get me
alive, if I can help it!" quivered young Overton.
"I'd sooner be killed at once than disgrace my
chevrons."</p>

<p>Two swift steps backward, and Sergeant Hal
caught up his revolver.</p>

<p>With this in his right hand, and stepping
panther-like, he returned to the fallen tent flap.</p>

<p>The approaching man with the rifle bent forward,
sweeping the tent flap aside.</p>

<p>"Come out, Sarge!" he ordered.</p>

<p>"If I have to," retorted Hal, setting his
teeth.</p>

<p>Grasping the revolver by the barrel end, he
sprang through, before the other fellow could
comprehend what was happening.</p>

<p>"Look out, there!" yelled one of the invaders,
coming up behind the man with the rifle.</p>

<p>It was too late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Crack! It was a fearful blow, the butt of
the heavy Army revolver landing on the fellow's
jaw and fracturing it.</p>

<p>"O-o-o-h!"</p>

<p>It was a wail of fearful agony, but under the
circumstances Sergeant Overton could not afford
to regret it.</p>

<p>The stricken man staggered back.</p>

<p>Hal poised for a bound, intending to snatch
the rifle from him.</p>

<p>As the fellow dropped back, however, his companion
coming up behind him was in time to
snatch the rifle, turning the muzzle on Overton.</p>

<p>There being not a second to lose, and the fight
unequal, Hal darted, instead, back to his tent
pole.</p>

<p>There hung a mirror that he had used in
shaving.</p>

<p>It took but an instant to get this. Then Hal
raced for a tree thirty feet away.</p>

<p>Dropping the small mirror into a pocket, Overton
started to climb the tree.</p>

<p>"Come down out of that tree, or we'll bring
you down!" roared an ugly voice.</p>

<p>"You'll have to drop me, then, if you want
me," taunted Hal coolly.</p>

<p>He was a dozen feet up the trunk by the time
that the man who now held that rifle gained the
base of the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Coming down, you&mdash;&mdash;?" called the ruffian
with an oath.</p>

<p>"No," responded Hal. "Coming up?"</p>

<p>"Come down, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Some mistake," sneered Hal, still climbing.
"I'm headed for the roof."</p>

<p>Below him he heard a threatening click as
the bolt of the rifle was thrown back.</p>

<p>"Hey! Don't shoot the kid&mdash;yet," ordered
another voice. "He'll come down when he sees
what we can do to him. He hasn't any show."</p>

<p>So the fellow under the tree went back to
join his six companions.</p>

<p>Dietz and Johnson were still holding up their
hands. This fact was no reflection on their
courage. They were trained fighting men, and
had sense enough to realize when the enemy had
"the drop" on them.</p>

<p>"You two soldiers," ordered the leader of
the ruffians, "lie down on your faces and hold
your hands behind your backs for tying."</p>

<p>Neither soldier, however, stirred as yet.</p>

<p>"You heard that, Sergeant?" called <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Deitz'">Dietz</ins>
dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Hal.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"You fellows get down on your faces&mdash;flop!"
broke in the leader of the ruffians.
"That's what you'll do!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you be kind enough to shut up?" retorted
Private Dietz coolly. "We're taking our
orders from the sergeant."</p>

<p>"Let him come down here and give the orders,
then," jeered the leader of the invaders.</p>

<p>"You'd better give in, Dietz and Johnson,"
order Sergeant Hal. "You can't do anything
and I don't want to see you killed."</p>

<p>"That's your order, then, is it, sergeant?"
inquired Private Johnson.</p>

<p>"Yes; it can't be helped."</p>

<p>Dietz and Johnson, therefore, lay down as
directed. Some of the scoundrels who were not
armed busied themselves with tying the soldiers,
and this work the miscreants did with a thoroughness
that spoke eloquently of practice.</p>

<p>But the diversion gave Hal a chance to do
something that had popped into his head at the
instant when he had stepped back for the mirror.</p>

<p>The sun was still sufficiently high for him to
catch the rays strongly on his small mirror.</p>

<p>Now, in the Army signaling work, one branch
has to do with heliographing; that is, flashing
a message by means of reflected rays of the
sun's light.</p>

<p>Swiftly enough the young sergeant caught the
flash, and found to his delight that he was able
to throw a fairly long flash.</p>

<p>"Camp in hands of ruffians. Help quick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/illus206.png" width="299" height="450" alt="The Mirror Was Shot From Hal&#39;s Hand." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Mirror Was Shot From Hal&#39;s Hand.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite his tremendous excitement, Sergeant
Overton endeavored to steady his right hand
enough to enable him to send the message quite
clearly.</p>

<p>Again and again he flashed the message, until
one of the invaders, glancing up at the tree top,
caught sight of the work that was going on.</p>

<p>"That kid's trying to send word to some one,"
guessed the leader. "Here, cub, hand me that
rifle."</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Smash!</p>

<p>It was a true shot, though how much of it was
due to luck Sergeant Hal could not surmise.</p>

<p>But the glass was shot from his hand, the
splintered bits falling to the ground.</p>

<p>"Next shot for you, kid!" warned the marksman
below.</p>

<p>"Yes?" mocked Overton.</p>

<p>"Surest thing in the world? Coming down,
or shall I bring you down?"</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Hal drew his own weapon up, firing as the
sight passed the human target.</p>

<p>It was a close shot, the revolver bullet carrying
away the fellow's cloth cap.</p>

<p>"I'm firing too high," spoke Hal as composedly
as though he did not feel any excitement.
"I'll fire for your belt line after this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>That was too much for the ruffian's composure.
He turned, running in a zig-zag line.</p>

<p>So Hal held his fire, awaiting results for a
moment. As he waited he felt for his revolver
ammunition.</p>

<p>Then he made a sickening discovery. He had
no revolver ammunition beyond the five cartridges
remaining in the cylinder of his weapon.</p>

<p>As for the invaders, they had more than three
hundred rounds of rifle ammunition now at their
disposal.</p>

<p>And they had fled to cover, too, but now Sergeant
Overton had the uncomfortable conviction
that three rifles were trained on him.</p>

<p>"Now, come down out of that tree on the
double quick!" commanded the leader of the
invaders.</p>

<p>"My coming will suit myself only," boasted
Hal in a tone conveying ten times the confidence
that he felt.</p>

<p>"That shot of yours may start help this way,"
continued the leader threateningly. "We ain't
going to take any chances. Start on the second,
or we'll begin shooting, and keep it up until
we tumble you out of that tree."</p>

<p>"You may fire whenever ready," mocked Hal.
"Every shot you fire will be a signal that will
make my friends come faster."</p>

<p>Bang! It was the leader himself who fired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
The bullet clipped off a leaf within an inch of
Sergeant Overton's ear.</p>

<p>Crack! The boyish young sergeant was all
there with the grit. He fired straight back at
the leader, the bullet striking the rock before
the other's face.</p>

<p>Now two more shots clipped close to the young
soldier. Hal answered with one.</p>

<p>But he tried to steady himself. He realized
that he had but three fighting shots left, and
that he must make them count.</p>

<p>"But maybe three are enough to last me as
long as I'm going to live, anyway," reflected
Sergeant Overton grimly.</p>

<p>There was not much comfort in that thought,
but Hal drew himself around more behind the
tree trunk in order to shield himself as much
as possible, although the tree trunk would be
no real protection from bullets.</p>

<p>The Army bullet, at an ordinary range, will
pierce three solid feet of standing oak.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE EIGHTH MOCCASIN APPEARS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"GIVE it up?" queried the leader.</div>

<p>"I answered you before on that
head," retorted Sergeant Overton.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, kid. We don't want to hurt
you. All we want is that revolver."</p>

<p>"I don't want to give it up," rejoined Hal.</p>

<p>"You'd better!"</p>

<p>"It isn't mine to give, anyway. It belongs
to the United States Government."</p>

<p>"Uncle Sam will never see that revolver
again," declared the leader of the invaders, with
profane emphasis. "And you'll never see your
friends again if you don't hit it fast for the
ground."</p>

<p>"I'm here until further orders."</p>

<p>"You've got your orders!"</p>

<p>"I don't take any orders from you," retorted
Hal with fine scorn.</p>

<p>"Open up on the fool, boys&mdash;all together!"</p>

<p>Three spurts of flame jetted out from the cover
that the ruffians had taken.</p>

<p>Hal steadied his arm by resting it across a
branch before him, and fired back, his aim, as
before, at the leader.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>He had the satisfaction of seeing that rascal's
head duck below cover.</p>

<p>Though he could not know it then, Overton
had clipped a lock of hair from the fellow's
hatless head.</p>

<p>Another volley, which Hal answered with another
shot.</p>

<p>"What do you fellows want with guns if you
can't shoot better!" hailed Overton derisively.</p>

<p>He didn't want them to shoot any better, but
he was trying to anger them and thus make
their shooting wilder.</p>

<p>"It won't take us more than half a minute
more to get you," flung back the leader.</p>

<p>Now that fellow raised himself, exposing himself
more, but getting a solid left-hand rest for
his rifle.</p>

<p>Hal could see and feel that the rifle was
pointed fairly at him.</p>

<p>On the instinct of the moment the young sergeant
fired. And he would have scored, had
he not seen the other two riflemen leaving their
cover also to get a better aim. That realization
spoiled his shot.</p>

<p>"Gracious! That was my last cartridge,
too!" groaned the young sergeant inwardly.</p>

<p>The realization made him feel creepy. It is
one thing to fight bravely, when one has the
fighting tools and a knowledge of their use. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
it is quite another thing to face the certainty of
being helpless with so many armed foes bent
on one's destruction.</p>

<p>None the less, summoning up all his courage,
Hal broke the revolver at the breech, allowing
the ejector to shed the empty shells on the ground
underneath.</p>

<p>With lightning motions Hal went through the
sham of filling his cylinder with fresh cartridges.</p>

<p>"No use, little man! No use at all. If you
had any more cartridges you'd get me now&mdash;but
you can't. Come on, boys! We'll go under
the tree and smoke him out!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the leader moved boldly from
cover, exposing the whole length of his body.</p>

<p>It would have made a splendid mark for as
expert a shot as Sergeant Hal Overton. The
soldier boy did raise his revolver, as though
to shoot, but the leader, coolly confident, continued
to come forward.</p>

<p>Of course Hal could not shoot, and the rest
seeing that, also came out from cover.</p>

<p>Chuckling, all but the one whose jaw Hal had
injured, the wretches moved forward, halting
just under the tree.</p>

<p>"Coming down now?" demanded the leader,
directing the muzzle of his stolen rifle up the
tree.</p>

<p>"I don't know," mimicked Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ever hear what the treed 'coon said to Davy
Crockett?" inquired the scoundrel facetiously.</p>

<p>"If it's a chestnut I'll stand hearing it
again," proposed the young sergeant.</p>

<p>"Well, friend, when the raccoon saw Davy
pointing his gun upward, he called down: 'Don't
shoot, Davy! I'll come down.'"</p>

<p>"Great!" mocked young Overton.</p>

<p>"Are you going to do like the 'coon?"</p>

<p>Hal's answer was to raise his right hand suddenly
and hurling his now useless revolver.</p>

<p>There was no time to dodge. One of the
riflemen below received the impact of the descending
weapon squarely on top of his head
and he keeled over, falling into a bush.</p>

<p>"You said all you wanted was my revolver,"
announced Sergeant Hal. "Well, you have it.
Now on your way with it."</p>

<p>The dropped revolver had been picked up by
another of the crowd, and now two men raised
their guns to shoot Hal Overton out of the tree.</p>

<p>But their leader struck down their guns.</p>

<p>"None of that, unless we have to," he commanded.
"The sergeant's a game one, and he's
not to blame for trying to defend his camp. He
can't do any more harm now, and I won't have
him hurt unless he forces us to do it. Now,
then, young man, are you coming down out of
that tree?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" challenged Hal. "You said that all
you wanted was my revolver. You have that
now, and all the rifles in camp. What do you
need of me?"</p>

<p>"We've got to slip away from here quick," retorted
the leader with a deceptive show of good-nature
and fair-mindedness. "But do you think,
Sergeant, we're going to be fools enough to
dust out of here and leave you to come down
out of the tree and trail us along, then come back
here for help and bag us all. No, no, young
man! We know the regulars, and we're not
going to leave any cards in the hands of the
fighting line of the Army."</p>

<p>"But it's so comfortable up here," objected
Hal.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give you, Sergeant, until I
count three. Then, if you haven't started, we'll
simply have to bring you down like a cantankerous
grizzly. Or, if you start and then stop
again, we'll shoot just the same. We can't afford
to waste any more time talking."</p>

<p>Where had Hal seen this man before? Where
and when had he heard that voice?</p>

<p>Face and voice both seemed strangely familiar,
yet, to save him, Overton could not place the
fellow at that moment.</p>

<p>"One!" counted the leader, and Hal saw three
rifle muzzles pointed at him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two!"</p>

<p>"All right! I'm the 'coon. Be with you in
a minute, Davy Crockett," laughed Sergeant
Hal Overton.</p>

<p>It was hard luck, but the soldier boy felt that
he had made all the fight that could be expected
of any one. There seemed no sense in being
killed for sheer stubbornness, now that he had
not a ghost of a chance of fighting back.</p>

<p>Having once started groundward, Overton
continued to descend rapidly.</p>

<p>As he reached the last limb on his descent he
took a swift slide and landed among his captors.</p>

<p>"Good boy," mimicked the leader of the invaders.
"Now continue to be sensible. Just
lie down on your face and put your hands behind
your back the way your two men did. Nothing
happened to them and nothing worse will
happen to you."</p>

<p>The wretch's words were smooth and oily.
To Hal it really looked as though this fellow
respected gameness enough not to take it out
on a defenseless enemy.</p>

<p>So Hal lay face downward and gave up his
hands for binding.</p>

<p>Wrap! wrap! He felt the cord passing swiftly
around his wrists, and then an extra turn was
taken around his ankles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your name's Overton, isn't it?" asked the
leader with a wicked grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you're the man we want."</p>

<p>"From the way you acted I judged that you
wanted me," mocked Hal dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but we wanted you for more than general
reasons. In fact, we want you, most of all,
for purely personal reasons. Or, at least, one
of our fellows does. Here he comes."</p>

<p>An eighth man of the wretched crew now came
swiftly forward from the hiding that he had
kept from the first.</p>

<p>As he came he chuckled maliciously, and Hal
Overton knew that sinister laugh.</p>

<p>Then the fellow halted, bending over the prostrate,
tied young sergeant.</p>

<p>The face was the face of that evil deserter
from the Army&mdash;ex-Private Hinkey!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE ENEMY HAS HIS INNINGS</h3>


<div class='cap'>"I'D much better have stayed up the tree
and been shot out of it!" flashed through
Sergeant Hal's startled brain.</div>

<p>"Howdy!" jeered Hinkey, leering wickedly.
"Didn't expect to see me, did you?"</p>

<p>"No," Hal admitted frankly.</p>

<p>"It's my inning now, Overton."</p>

<p>"It looks like it."</p>

<p>"And I'm to have my own way with you&mdash;you
officers' boot-lick!"</p>

<p>"That's a lie, Hinkey, and you know it!"
broke in the deep, indignant voice of Private
Dietz. "Overton's a man, first, last and always.
He's worth a million of your kind."</p>

<p>"Good!" added Private Johnson valiantly.
"And true, too! I never realized it until to-day,
either."</p>

<p>"Oh, you both hold your tongues," ordered
Hinkey, glaring over at the pair of bound soldiers
who lay beyond. "You fellows are no
good, either. No man that'll stay in the Army
is any good."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know why you left, Hinkey,"
jeered Dietz. "I've wondered a lot about that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, have you?" snarled Hinkey. "Nobody
but a boot-lick would stay in the Army, and I
don't lick any man's boots, not for the whole
Army."</p>

<p>"Come, hurry up, Hink, and have your grudge
satisfied, and come along. We don't want to be
caught by a lot of soldiers. All the shooting
we've done here will be sure to attract the
hunters."</p>

<p>"No it won't," rejoined Hinkey. "We trailed
the hunting parties, and they went out in three
squads, in three different directions. Now, any
of the hunters that hear a lot of firing will only
think that one of the other parties has run into
a lot of game."</p>

<p>This was true. Hal Overton hadn't thought
of it before in that light. And, in addition, it
was rather unlikely that any of the hunters
had chanced to see his mirror-thrown signals
in the short time that had passed before the glass
had been shot from his hands.</p>

<p>The rascal floored by the revolver which the
sergeant had thrown was now coming to, for
one of the crew had been dashing water in his
face.</p>

<p>Not far away sat the man whose jaw Hal
had damaged. He was groaning a bit, despite
his efforts to make no fuss.</p>

<p>"Look at our two mates this sergeant boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
has put out of action," growled Hinkey, trying
to inflame his comrades.</p>

<p>"They were hit in fair fight," replied the
leader. "The sergeant kid doesn't belong to
our side, but I don't hold his fighting grit against
him."</p>

<p>"You'd hold anything and everything against
him if you knew him as well as I do," retorted
Hinkey.</p>

<p>He was still standing over his young victim,
gazing down gloatingly at him.</p>

<p>"And now the time has come to square matters
up with you, younker," went on Hinkey
tauntingly. "It's all my way now."</p>

<p>Hal looked up at him steadily, but without
speaking. The boy knew better than to say
anything foolish that would needlessly anger
this brute, who now held the situation all in his
own hands.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you talk back, Overton?"
demanded Hinkey sneeringly.</p>

<p>Just the ghost of a smile flickered over Overton's
face.</p>

<p>"Laughing at me, are you?" yelled Hinkey,
trying to work himself into a more brutal rage.</p>

<p>Hal spoke at last.</p>

<p>"No," he answered.</p>

<p>"If you ain't laughing," continued the brute,
"what are you doing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just thinking how sorry I am for you," Hal
flashed back coolly.</p>

<p>"Sorry?" echoed the fellow bitterly. "You'd
better waste your sorrow on yourself! What
are you feeling badly about me for?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking," went on Hal slowly, and
with no trace of taunt in his voice, "what a sad
come-down you have had. You were in the
Army, wearing its uniform, and with every right
to look upon yourself as a man. You could have
gone on being trusted. You could have raised
yourself. Instead, you have followed a naturally
bad bent and made yourself a thousand times
worse than you ever needed to be. Hinkey, do
you wonder that I'm sorry for you, when I find
that you have fallen outside of an honest man's
estate?"</p>

<p>"Good! Tell him some more, Sarge," came
from Dietz.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" raged Hinkey, turning
and catching his new leader's eye. "Do you
hear what the boot-lick insinuates about the new
crowd I've joined?"</p>

<p>"It's your affair&mdash;your battle, Hinkey," replied
the leader grimly. "Don't try to drag us
in."</p>

<p>"You're making such a beast of yourself,
Hinkey, that even your own gang don't respect
you," taunted Johnson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"A crowd of Colorado wild-cats couldn't respect
such a fellow," supplied Dietz.</p>

<p>With a snarl Hinkey ran over to where Dietz
and Johnson lay, giving each a hard kick. The
soldiers suffered the violence in silence.</p>

<p>"You two mind your own affairs," warned
Hinkey savagely. "Don't turn me against you.
I don't want to give either of you as bad a dose
as I've planned for this sergeant boy."</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Hinkey," warned the leader impatiently.
"You're wasting time that's worth
more to us than money. You said that if we'd
capture this boy for you, you'd cart him away
on your back, to settle with him later. Now do
it!"</p>

<p>"All in a minute," promised the deserter.
"But, first of all, are you going to take the other
two soldiers with you?"</p>

<p>"No. We don't need 'em."</p>

<p>"Then I don't want this fellow Overton to go
along with us with his eyes open. He'd know
our whole route if he managed to get away from
us, and then he'd bring the regulars down on
us. You don't want that?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Then I'll stun this sergeant boy, and I'll
do it so hard that he won't open his eyes in
ten miles of traveling," promised Hinkey.</p>

<p>With that he turned to Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Overton, I'm going to hit you, and I'm
going to hit you so hard that you won't even
see stars. Close your eyes if you're afraid to
see the blow coming!"</p>

<p>But Hal merely opened his eyes the wider,
smiling back with a confidence in himself that
maddened the brute.</p>

<p>With a snarl like a panther's Hinkey crouched
over the young sergeant, holding his hand high
before striking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE NAVY HEARD FROM</h3>


<div class='cap'>LOOKING up at that hand Hal Overton
saw a spot of blood appear suddenly in
the middle of the palm.</div>

<p>In the same moment there came the sharp
crack of a rifle.</p>

<p>The blow never descended on Overton's upturned
face.</p>

<p>Instead, Hinkey uttered a startled yell, tottered
to his feet, then threw himself over on
his face.</p>

<p>For, following that first shot, came a volley of
them, accompanied by the whistling of bullets
through the camp.</p>

<p>The leader of the invaders pitched and fell,
shot through the hip.</p>

<p>"Take to cover, boys!" roared the stricken
leader. "Take my rifle, too. Defend yourselves.
The soldiers are down on us!"</p>

<p>But Sergeant Hal, after that first moment of
joyous surprise, felt a thrill of astonishment.</p>

<p>The bullets that were whistling through camp
had not the sound of Army missiles!</p>

<p>Yet the young sergeant had no time to speculate
on this discovery, for now he heard a voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and a wholly strange one, shout, as the volley
ceased:</p>

<p>"You men surrender, if you don't want to be
riddled. If you start to make a move away
from camp we'll drop every one of you before
any man can reach cover. We mean business!"</p>

<p>"Hello! What's going on here? Halt! Deploy,
there! Lie down! Ready&mdash;load&mdash;aim!"</p>

<p>That was Noll Terry's voice, and the young
sergeant was right on his word like a flash.</p>

<p>While the first party was hidden behind cover
to the northward, Sergeant Noll and his men
had come up from the westward.</p>

<p>"We're friends," hailed that same voice from
northward. "Who are you over to the westward?
Who commands there?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Oliver Terry, United States
Army," Noll called back.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Sergeant! Stay in command.
We'll back up any move you make," came from
northward.</p>

<p>"Do you rascally prowlers surrender?" called
Noll.</p>

<p>"It's about the only thing that seems left to
do," sullenly admitted the leader of the invaders.</p>

<p>"Then hold up your hands and step away
from those rifles," ordered Noll.</p>

<p>That command was obeyed, except by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
man whose head had been battered by Hal's flying
revolver.</p>

<p>"Have they any other weapons, Hal?" called
Sergeant Noll.</p>

<p>"So far as I know they haven't," Sergeant
Hal answered.</p>

<p>"You to the north!" called Noll.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, there!" came the good-natured answer.</p>

<p>"Will you move in, covering the prisoners
with your rifles?"</p>

<p>"Gladly, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Out of brushwood cover to the northward
stepped three men. One was a middle-aged
man, a mountaineer if dress and manner went
for anything.</p>

<p>With him, supporting this guide on each side
were two tall, very straight young men who appeared
to be about twenty-three years of age
each. These younger men were nattily though
plainly attired in corduroy, with leggings and
caps.</p>

<p>"Just stand right there, and hold the prisoners,
please," directed Sergeant Terry.</p>

<p>Then Noll's next step was to move in with his
own men, four in number.</p>

<p>"Get the handcuffs," directed Noll. "I think
we've enough to go around."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying Noll stepped over to his chum,
quickly freeing him.</p>

<p>"Get up, Sergeant Overton," cried Noll, as
he cut the last cord at his chum's ankles. "And
now I turn the command over to you."</p>

<p>Most of the prisoners took their capture in an
ugly mood. Their leader, however, affected,
coolly, to regard it all as the fortunes of the
game.</p>

<p>"Here don't handcuff any of the disabled
men," directed Sergeant Hal. "Green, you
stand as a guard over those wounded. It's
bad enough to be hurt, without having one's
hands fixed so that he can't aid himself any
in his misery."</p>

<p>"You want Hinkey ironed, don't you?" inquired
Noll.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But he's an Army deserter."</p>

<p>"If he gets away from where he's sitting he'll
be only the remains of one," returned Sergeant
Overton dryly. "But Hinkey is wounded, and
he'll need his hands free in order to look after
himself."</p>

<p>Hinkey, however, did not deign to notice this
grace by so much as a look or a word.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with these fellows?"
asked Noll presently.</p>

<p>"It doesn't rest with me," Hal replied. "This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
is a purely military matter, and I shall wait to
get Lieutenant Prescott's orders."</p>

<p>"Then Prescott belongs with this camp?"
queried the taller, finer-looking of the pair of
young strangers who had given Hal his first
aid.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Prescott is with this camp; yes,
sir," Hal replied, laying considerable emphasis
on the title.</p>

<p>"We're friends of his," explained the same
stranger. "So, if you don't mind, we'll just
wait for him."</p>

<p>"If you're friends of Lieutenant Prescott,
then make yourselves very much at home, sir,"
Hal answered cordially. "Any friend of Lieutenant
Prescott has B company for his friends
also."</p>

<p>Johnson and Dietz, who had been freed right
after Sergeant Hal, were now busy once more
with preparations for the extra meal.</p>

<p>"Had we better provide for three extra plates,
Sarge?" inquired Johnson, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It looks very much that way," smiled Hal.
"And be sure to have a great plenty of everything.
Vreeland will help you, as you've lost
some time."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the footsteps of others
were heard approaching camp. Then in came
Lieutenant Prescott, with Corporal Cotter and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
five men. They were carrying two antelope and
a fine, big bear.</p>

<p>But the instant that Lieutenant Prescott
caught sight of the strangers he dropped everything,
rushing forward with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"By all that's wonderful! Dave Darrin!
Dan Dalzell!"</p>

<p>Then the soldiers were treated to the unexpected
spectacle of their lieutenant embracing
the two young men in corduroy.</p>

<p>Soon after, however, Mr. Prescott wheeled
about, one friend on either side of him.</p>

<p>"Attention! Men, the gentleman on my right
is Midshipman David Darrin, United States
Navy, and the gentleman on my left, Midshipman
Daniel Dalzell, also of the Navy. They
are to be treated with all the respect and courtesy
due to their rank."</p>

<p>Readers of the "<span class="smcap">High School Boys' Series</span>"
and of the "<span class="smcap">Annapolis Series</span>" will recall these
two splendid young Naval officers, first as High
School athletes, and later among the most famous
of the midshipmen at the United States
Naval Academy.</p>

<p>"But how on earth did a lucky wind come
up to blow you out this way?" asked Lieutenant
Prescott.</p>

<p>"Good fortune ruled it that we should be assigned
to duty on the China station," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Midshipman Darrin. "So we're journeying
across the continent to San Francisco, on our
way. But our orders allowed us time enough
to stop over a fortnight on the way. Dick, did
you imagine we'd go through Colorado without
stopping to see you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," glowed Lieutenant Prescott.
"When did you arrive at Clowdry?"</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday. Ever since then
we've been on the way. As soon as we reached
the end of the rail part of the journey here we
engaged Mr. Sanderson as our guide. While
coming along this afternoon we saw something
like helio signals flashing in the air. The message
was one for help, so we hustled along, our
guide piloting. And, from some things I've
heard and observed since arrival, Dick, I imagine
we got here just about in time."</p>

<p>"As you always did," laughed Lieutenant
Prescott. "But, now that I've got my breath
back from my delight&mdash;Sergeant Overton, what
is the meaning of prisoners in camp? And
where did you find Hinkey?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear quite a lot of firing, sir?"
asked Sergeant Hal.</p>

<p>"Firing? Considerable, but I thought some
party nearer in had struck such a haul of game
as you landed last night, Sergeant. Go on and
tell me about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>This Hal did, and it was all news to the lieutenant,
for neither he nor any member of his
hunting party had seen the helio signals.</p>

<p>Just as the brief spirited tale was finished the
remainder of the hunting party came in, one
of them being a private of hospital corps. To
this man was entrusted the attending of the injured
invaders.</p>

<p>Hinkey fairly cowered before the scorn that
was apparent in the eyes of all his former comrades.</p>

<p>The evening meal was now nearly ready. By
Hal's direction another table was set up for
Lieutenant Prescott and his guests.</p>

<p>Then came the early, cool night. Prescott
and his Naval friends sat apart for an hour,
talking over the old times. Then, at last, they
came over and joined the soldiers.</p>

<p>"May I ask a question, Lieutenant?" inquired
Sergeant Hal, saluting.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"What is to be done with the prisoners?"</p>

<p>"You are in command here, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"But isn't this a greater military matter, sir,
than the mere command of a hunting camp?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I need to take command, Sergeant.
But I will offer you a suggestion, if you
wish."</p>

<p>"If you will be so kind, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, this general group of prisoners belong
to the civil authorities. You will find a jail and
a sheriff very near the point where we left the
train."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And Hinkey?"</p>

<p>"He is a prisoner of the United States Army.
You can put him in charge of the same sheriff,
asking him to hold Hinkey until a guard from
Fort Clowdry arrives to take him. A wire to
the post can be sent from the station."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Then I think I will detail
Sergeant Terry, a driver and a guard of six men
to escort the prisoners to the sheriff. The hospital
man had better go along, too, and the injured
men can travel in the wagon."</p>

<p>"That disposition will do very well, Sergeant.
But Sergeant Terry and his men will very likely
be away four days altogether."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Saluting, and including the young Naval officers
in his salute, Sergeant Overton went over
to explain the plan to Noll.</p>

<p>"What very boyish youngsters those two sergeants
are," remarked Midshipman Darrin.</p>

<p>"Young, yes, but as seasoned and good men
as we have in the company or the regiment,"
replied Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"They certainly look like fine soldiers,"
agreed Midshipman Dalzell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"They'll look very much like fine young officers,
one of these days, or I miss my guess by
a mile," answered Prescott. "Colonel North is
very proud of these two boys, and so are Major
Silsbee and Captain Cortland."</p>

<p>In the morning the three wounded men were
placed in one of the two wagons belonging to
camp. Though their hands were left free, all
three had their feet shackled to staples inside
the wagon.</p>

<p>The other five prisoners stood sulkily behind
the wagon. Noll assembled the guard at the
side of the trail.</p>

<p>"Climb up on the wagon, hospital man,"
called Noll. "Start ahead, driver. Squad, by
twos, right, forward march."</p>

<p>Then the party started out.</p>

<p>Two of the remaining soldiers were detailed
for camp, as usual. The other enlisted men
went off in a hunting party by themselves.</p>

<p>All except Sergeant Hal. He had been invited
to go with Lieutenant Prescott and the latter's
friends, and had gladly accepted.</p>

<p>Sanderson, the guide, having been paid by his
Naval employers, had already taken the trail.</p>

<p>"I hope you bring us luck, Dave and Dan,"
announced Lieutenant Prescott, as the party
started. "We are still far shy of the amount
of game we want to take back to the post."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES SERVICES FIGHT TOGETHER</h3>


<div class='cap'>FOR more than an hour Midshipman Darrin
and Sergeant Overton had been away
from the rest of the party, seeking
tracks or other signs of wild game.</div>

<p>"Sergeant," spoke Midshipman Darrin, at
last, "I hope you won't be offended by the
opinion I have formed of you."</p>

<p>"What is that, sir?" asked Hal Overton.</p>

<p>"I've been watching you a bit, and I've come
to the conclusion that you're an uncommonly
fine and keen soldier."</p>

<p>"Not much chance in that for offense, sir,"
laughed the boyish sergeant.</p>

<p>"But you're of the Army," said Mr. Darrin,
"and I don't know whether you believe that
a sailor is a judge of a soldier."</p>

<p>"Quite naturally, sir," laughed Hal, "I am
wholly willing to believe in the value of your
judgment. And I have another reason."</p>

<p>"What is that, Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, you're a very particular friend of
Lieutenant Prescott's, and we men of B company
are ready to believe in any one whom

<p>"You have another very fine fellow for an
officer in your regiment," Mr. Darrin went on.
"And that is Greg Holmes&mdash;pardon me, Lieutenant
Holmes. He's as fine, in every way, as
Mr. Prescott himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Lieutenant Holmes is as popular
with the men as any officer in the regiment can
be."</p>

<p>"You see," smiled Mr. Darrin reminiscently,
"when Dalzell, Prescott, Holmes and myself
were youngsters&mdash;or smaller youngsters than
we are now&mdash;we were all chums together in the
same High School."</p>

<p>Then, finding a ready and appreciative listener
Midshipman Darrin plunged into the recounting
of many of the former adventures of
that famous group of schoolboys once known
as Dick &amp; Co., whose doings were fully set
forth in the "<span class="smcap">High School Boys' Series</span>."</p>

<p>Sergeant Hal heard, also, of Tom Reade and
Harry Hazelton, the two remaining members of
Dick &amp; Co., whose adventures, after leaving
school, are now being set forth in the "<span class="smcap">Young
Engineers' Series</span>."</p>

<p>But Overton did not hear about the sweethearts
of these former High School chums.
Sweethearts were too sacred to be discussed
with comparative strangers.</p>

<p>"Now, Prescott informs me that you two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
young sergeants intend to work for commissions
from the ranks," said Mr. Darrin, after a
while.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that was our idea in entering the
service."</p>

<p>"I hope, heartily, Sergeant Overton, that both
you and your friend win out with your ambitions."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I have a very particular reason for wishing
you that luck," smiled Midshipman Darrin,
"and you are at liberty, Sergeant, to ask me
what it is."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"I want to see both yourself and Sergeant
Terry succeed because I don't believe the service
can afford to be without two such unusually
good officers as you and Sergeant Terry would
make."</p>

<p>Hal flushed, tried to utter his thanks, and
found himself confused, for Midshipman Darrin,
who was taller, was gazing down at him
with a very friendly look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"My hand has been itching for something all
day," the young Naval officer went on. "Sergeant,
I want to shake hands with you, if you
don't mind."</p>

<p>Their hands met in hearty clasp.</p>

<p>"I shall have Prescott keep me posted regarding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
you two young men," went on Dave
Darrin. "And, when you two are officers, if
you are ever near any craft on which I'm on
duty I want you to promise me that you'll come
to visit me."</p>

<p>"You know how much delight that would give
both Sergeant Terry and myself, sir."</p>

<p>"Attention&mdash;to the job!" suddenly muttered
Dave Darrin, in a low voice.</p>

<p>Their long tramp had taken them alongside
a low ledge.</p>

<p>As Darrin spoke in that low voice he raised
his hunting rifle quickly, bringing the butt to
his shoulder with a jerk.</p>

<p>He fired&mdash;straight at a bear, not more than
five feet over their heads and at a total distance
of only about ten feet.</p>

<p>But in that same instant the big, brown brute
moved, and the bullet intended for his heart
merely clipped away a bit of hair at the bottom
of the animal's belly.</p>

<p>Bruin's first move had been to get away from
danger, but now, at the shot, he became very
much angered.</p>

<p>A second, swift leap, and the big animal
jumped downward, landing on Midshipman
Darrin's chest and bearing him to the earth.</p>

<p>"Lie still, sir!" gasped Sergeant Hal.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/illus238.png" width="298" height="450" alt="&quot;Lie Still, Sir!&quot; Gasped Sergeant Hal." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Lie Still, Sir!&quot; Gasped Sergeant Hal.</span>
</div>

<p>There was but a single cartridge in Overton's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
rifle. He clicked the bolt, then aimed all in a
flash.</p>

<p>In his agitation Hal succeeded only in grazing
the top of the animal's back.</p>

<p>But <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Bruin'">bruin</ins>, crouched on Darrin's body, raised
his head and turned it snarlingly toward Hal.</p>

<p>Everything that was to be done must be done
in a moment. Fortunately, the young sergeant
wore his bayonet in scabbard at his belt.</p>

<p>Like a flash Sergeant Overton fixed that
bayonet to the muzzle of his rifle, bruin regarding
him with a hostile glitter in his eyes, while
Midshipman Darrin, whose rifle had been hurled
just out of his reach, had the presence of mind
to lie utterly still.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll see what you'll do, bruin!" quivered
Hal, making a swift lunge for the animal's
side.</p>

<p>What bruin did was to leap away from the
midshipman's prostrate body. Despite the
bear's lumbering body and shambling gait he
can be spry enough at need.</p>

<p>Hal's thrust, therefore, failed to land directly,
but merely ripped along the animal's coat.</p>

<p>The momentum that followed the miss caused
Sergeant Hal Overton to fall forward to his
knees. And now the enraged bruin made
straight for him.</p>

<p>There was time to do but one thing. Sergeant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Hal made a lunge direct at the bear's
eyes.</p>

<p>With that menace of cold steel before his eyes
the bear dodged to one side, then rose to his
hind feet.</p>

<p>Rising, Hal took his stand on the defensive,
for now bruin was determined on a finish fight.</p>

<p>Straight at Bruin's heart lunged Hal, but
it was a game at which two could play.</p>

<p>Bruin's massive left paw, backed by
prodigious strength, swept the bayoneted rifle
aside, fairly wrenching it from Overton's grasp.</p>

<p>So now the bear was ready, either for embrace
or pursuit of this now helpless enemy.</p>

<p>Midshipman Dave Darrin, U. S. N., at the
instant when he found the weight of the bulky
animal removed from his body, had crawled
noiselessly away for a few feet.</p>

<p>Now Darrin dropped to one knee, the rifle at
ready. Aiming with the utmost coolness, the
young Naval officer fired.</p>

<p>Straight and true went the bullet this time
into Bruin's heart.</p>

<p>The big mass swayed, then fell. There was
barely a gasp to signal the bear's end of life.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," remarked the midshipman coolly,
"your conduct just now fully confirmed what I
said about your being a valuable man for the
Army."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"I probably wouldn't have been in the Army
much longer, sir, if you hadn't got your rifle and
fired just as you did," retorted the boyish sergeant.</p>

<p>"And I couldn't have reached my rifle if you
hadn't shown the very unusual nerve to try to
whip a bear in a bayonet charge."</p>

<p>"I know a good deal better, now, Mr. Darrin,
how useless a bayonet attack is against a bear.
Though Sergeant Terry and I once made a good
haul of bear's meat with bayonets when at too
close quarters with bears."</p>

<p>"You'll have to tell me about that as you go
along," remarked the young Naval officer.</p>

<p>Noting the locality well, they left the bear
where it had fallen, to be taken up a little later.</p>

<p>"Hello, sir. There are other shots from our
party," cried Overton, as three rifle reports rang
out not far away. "That seems to show, sir,
that they're meeting with luck, too."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>


<div class='cap'>AFTER that, through the days to come,
the luck seemed to boom.</div>

<p>At the end of four days young Sergeant
Terry and his guard returned, having
turned over all the prisoners to the sheriff of
Blank County.</p>

<p>Noll had also wired the post at Fort Clowdry,
and had received the post adjutant's answer that
a guard would be sent to bring Private Hinkey
back for trial on the charge of desertion.</p>

<p>"The sheriff knew all the prisoners at once,
all except Hinkey," Sergeant Noll reported back
to his chum and to Lieutenant Prescott. "The
leader of the gang is a half-popular fellow with
some classes here in the mountains. Despite
the fact that he's a desperado, he is often surprisingly
good-natured, and always game when
he loses. His name is Griller&mdash;Butch Griller,
he's called. His crew are called the Moccasin
Gang, because Griller has always preferred that
his men wear moccasins instead of shoes. Shoes
may give out in the wilds, but moccasins can
always be made whenever an antelope is killed."</p>

<p>"The Moccasin Gang?" repeated Lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Prescott. "Why, I've heard stories about that
desperate crowd. But what were they doing
around our camp?"</p>

<p>"Griller told me about that before we reached
town," Sergeant Noll continued. "Griller and
his men, it seems, were being pursued by the
sheriff of the next county. He trailed them to
a cabin where they had stopped and made such
a complete surprise that Griller and his gang
got away only by jumping through the windows
without their arms. Then they traveled fast.
When they found that there were soldiers here,
the Moccasins hoped that they could get some
of our arms and ammunition. Thus provided,
they hadn't much doubt of being able to provide
themselves with more fighting hardware. And
they'd have gotten away, too, if it hadn't been
that Butch Griller had promised Hinkey a chance
for revenge on Sergeant Overton."</p>

<p>"But how did Hinkey come to be with them?"
broke in Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>"Griller told me about that, sir," Noll replied.
"Griller said he was standing on the
stoop of a house in Denver, near the ball
grounds, at the time when Hinkey deserted and
made his break to get away. Griller was in
Denver, on the quiet, to get more men together.
When he saw Hinkey running, he sized him up
as a man just deserted, and felt that Hinkey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
would be useful to him. So he called to
Hinkey, shoved him inside the house, and then,
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, but I remember that! And now I recall
where I saw Griller before. He told me
that Hinkey had rushed on and turned the next
street corner below. That threw me off the
track," muttered Sergeant Hal.</p>

<p>"Well, his new man Hinkey brought him no
luck," laughed Lieutenant Prescott. "And the
Moccasins won't do much more harm, unless
they manage to break jail."</p>

<p>"I don't believe they'll get away from that
sheriff, anyway, sir," remarked Sergeant Noll
grimly.</p>

<p>Noll Terry and the members of his guard were
in time to do some more hunting before the
happy soldiers' holiday came to an end.</p>

<p>When the expedition set out on its return
both of the big transport wagons carried all
the wild game meat that could be packed into
them, and officers' and enlisted men's messes
at Fort Clowdry celebrated in joyous fashion.</p>

<p>Ex-Private Hinkey, the deserter, was soon
tried by general court-martial, and sentenced
to be dismissed from the service, to forfeit all
pay and allowances and to serve two years at a
military prison.</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Prescott who gave one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the crowning sensations just toward the close
of Hinkey's trial.</p>

<p>Just before the battalion had left Fort
Clowdry to go to the military tournament at
Denver, First Sergeant Gray had asked every
soldier in B Company to turn in a slip on which
was written the name and address of his nearest
relative or friend.</p>

<p>As such data was already on file, the men
had wondered not a little at the request, but
they had complied. And now Lieutenant Prescott
informed the members of the court that it
had been a ruse of his.</p>

<p>These slips, together with the clumsily printed
note that had accompanied the return of Private
William Green's money, and also the envelope
addressed to Green, which latter Hal
had admitted as his writing&mdash;all, just before the
start of the hunting trip, had been forwarded
by Lieutenant Prescott to a famous writing expert
in the east.</p>

<p>Word had finally come from the expert to the
effect that the envelope had really been addressed
by Sergeant Hal, as that young soldier
admitted. The printed note to Green, however,
had been fashioned, the expert stated positively,
by the same man who had turned in the written
name and address of the "nearest friend" of
ex-Private Hinkey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>With this report the expert had sent a curiously
drawn chart showing resemblances between
Hinkey's admitted handwriting and the
printed note to Green. There were also photographs,
made with the aid of the microscope,
showing pronounced similarities of little strokes
and flourishes that were alike, both in Hinkey's
admitted handwriting and in the turns given to
some of the letters of the printed note.</p>

<p>Summing up all the evidence, the expert's report
stated positively that Hinkey was the one
who had fashioned the note to Green.</p>

<p>Finding that he could no longer deny his guilt,
Hinkey was finally driven to confession before
the court.</p>

<p>He had hated Sergeant (then Corporal) Overton
with such an intensity, Hinkey confessed,
that he had found himself willing to stop at nothing
that would damage the young soldier in any
way.</p>

<p>The envelope that Hal had addressed in his
own handwriting, it now turned out, was one
that he had so addressed at the request of Sergeant
Gray to enclose an official communication
that Gray had delivered to Private Green some
weeks before.</p>

<p>On finding this envelope, and realizing how
it would implicate Hal Overton, Hinkey had
even gone to the extreme of returning Green's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
money, when he might safely have kept and
spent it.</p>

<p>The reason why the money had not been found
during the search that had immediately followed
the discovery of the robbery in the squad room
was equally simple. Hinkey, the afternoon before
the robbery, had made the discovery of
a secret hiding place under the floor beside his
cot. That hiding place had been made, at great
trouble, by some soldier formerly living in the
squad room, and Hinkey's discovery of it had
been accidental.</p>

<p>Now that he was in the mood for confessing,
Hinkey also described how he had slipped the revolver
lightly under Sergeant Hal's blanket in
passing Overton's cot.</p>

<p>So the mystery was wholly cleared up at last,
and when ex-Private Hinkey departed to begin
his term of imprisonment the Army was well rid
of one who was in no sense fit to be the comrade
of any honest man wearing Uncle Sam's soldier
uniform.</p>

<p>Late in the fall the Colorado courts sent Griller
and his crew to the penitentiary for long
terms.</p>

<p>Immediately after Hinkey's trial, Lieutenant
Prescott, who had gone to all the trouble to
secure the evidence, drew up a brief statement,
setting forth Sergeant Hal Overton's complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
innocence of the squad-room robbery and declaring
who the scoundrel was.</p>

<p>This statement was published, by direction of
Colonel North, in the orders of the day.</p>

<p>Then, of course&mdash;human nature always works
this way&mdash;even those of the soldiers who had
most honestly believed in young Overton's guilt,
now swarmed around him to assure him that
they had never for an instant believed it possible
that he could be otherwise than a most
honest and wonderful soldier. Not they! Oh,
no! Now that they knew who the real culprit
was, these victims of human nature were ready
to cross their hearts that they had known all
along that Overton was absolutely guiltless; and
they had even suspected, all along, who would
turn out by and by to be the villain.</p>

<p>As has been said, this is human nature, and
therefore not to be sneered at. In fact, nearly
all of the men who protested so loudly to Hal
Overton had the actual grace to believe themselves&mdash;as
is always the case.</p>

<p>Private William Green, however, had been
cured, ever since the return of most of his
money, of the bad habit of carrying so much
around with him. Seldom after that was he
to be caught with more than a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>To Sergeant Hal it seemed impossible to
thank Lieutenant Prescott sufficiently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>For, though the young soldier, even if he had
not been vindicated so handsomely, would have
lived down most of the suspicion in time, yet
all of the stain would never have vanished had
it not been for Lieutenant Prescott.</p>

<p>Soldiers, from the very fact of living in isolated
little communities of their own, are somewhat
prone to gossip over purely garrison and
regimental affairs. So some of the story would
always have clung about Sergeant Overton's
reputation among his own kind.</p>

<p>"But you've stopped all of that forever, Lieutenant,"
protested Hal gratefully when calling,
by permission, at Mr. Prescott's quarters.</p>

<p>"I am glad I have then, my lad," smiled back
the young lieutenant. "I'm glad for your sake,
Sergeant, and, if you wish, you may consider
that I took much of the trouble on your account
personally. But I had also a still greater motive
in doing what I did."</p>

<p>"What was that, sir, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"My own love of the service," replied Lieutenant
Dick Prescott impressively. "What
would the service ever amount to, Sergeant, if
we allowed our best, brightest and most loyal
men to be downed by suspicions against them
that clearly had no base? What honest man
would care to enter or to stay in the ranks of
the Army if he did not feel sure that his officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
would work to see him righted and enjoying his
proper place in the esteem of his comrades. So,
Sergeant, don't try too hard to thank me.
Whatever I did for you personally, I did it ten
times more for the good of the tried, old, true-blue
United States Army."</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, Mr. Prescott went on:</p>

<p>"I've had my attention attracted to you more
than ever, both yourself and Sergeant Terry.
I see even new possibilities in you as soldiers.
Do you know why?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Prescott laughed lightly, though
there was a slight mist in his eyes as he answered:</p>

<p>"It may be news to you, Sergeant, but my
good old schoolboy friend, now Mr. Darrin,
of the Navy, has taken almost as much of a
liking to you two youngsters as though you were
pet younger brothers of his. Darrin watched
you both often while he was here, after we returned
from the hunting trip. He spoke of you
frequently, and seemed to have noticed so many
excellencies in both yourself and Sergeant Terry
that I grew ashamed of my own slight powers
of observation. Of course, you don't know anything
of the old days when Mr. Darrin, Mr.
Dalzell, Mr. Holmes and myself were all devoted
chums."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I do, sir," Sergeant Hal rejoined.</p>

<p>"You do? How?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin told me a lot that day he and I
spent some hours hunting together. He told
me a lot about your old schoolboy days."</p>

<p>"That's only another proof of how much Darrin
likes you, then," pursued the young lieutenant
warmly. "Darrin isn't usually very talkative
with new acquaintances. But what I was
going to say was that, back in our schooldays,
I often made a great reputation for wisdom
just because I accepted Darrin's wise estimates
of human nature and people. So now Darrin's
praises of you two young sergeants have made
me feel that I have missed a lot of what I should
have observed about you both."</p>

<p>"Both Terry and myself will feel highly honored
over such good opinions of us, sir," Hal
replied.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't talk quite so freely if I didn't
know that you're both so level-headed that a
little praise will make better, instead of worse
soldiers of you, Sergeant Overton. Of course,
as one of your officers, I understand that both
of you young sergeants are working onward and
forward with the hope of one day winning commissions
in the line of the Army. I wish you
every kind of good luck, Overton. Here's my
hand on it. And some day I hope to be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to offer you my hand again&mdash;when, wearing the
shoulder straps, you come into an officers' mess,
somewhere, as a fellow-member of that mess."</p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin made both Terry and myself
promise, sir, that if we ever win commissions,
we'll visit him on his ship as soon after as possible."</p>

<p>"Mr. Darrin and Mr. Dalzell are on their way
to China by this time," continued Lieutenant
Prescott. "From the China station their next
detail will undoubtedly be the Philippine station.
And that's where, after a while, this regiment
will be due to go."</p>

<p>And that is just where the Thirty-fourth Regiment
did go, as will be discovered in the next
volume in this series, which is published under
the title: "<span class="smcap">Uncle Sam's Boys in the Philippines</span>;
Or, Following the Flag Against the
Moros."</p>

<p>Not only did our two young sergeant friends
taste all the joys of life and residence in these
romantic tropical possessions of the United
States, but they were destined also to see and
take part in a lot of spirited fighting against
brown enemies of the United States.</p>

<p>But these adventures must be reserved for the
next volume.</p>
